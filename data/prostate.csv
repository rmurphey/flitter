Rubitecan is an oral compound being developed for the treatment of pancreatic cancer and other solid tumours by SuperGen. One of the major benefits of rubitecan is that it can be administered in an outpatient setting, so patients can be treated in their homes. Rubitecan was isolated by the Stehlin Foundation in the US. SuperGen is currently awaiting regulatory approval in the US and the EU for rubitecan in the treatment of pancreatic cancer. At the BIO-2004 conference, SuperGen announced it is seeking a partner for rubitecan for territories outside the US. SuperGen acquired exclusive worldwide rights to rubitecan from the Stehlin Foundation in 1997 except in Mexico, Canada, Spain, Japan, the UK, France, Italy and Germany. SuperGen has also received approval from the US FDA to use its own manufactured rubitecan in clinical trials. SuperGen and the Stehlin Foundation have an 8-year research agreement that secures global rights to other camptothecins and additional anticancer compounds for the former. In December 1999, SuperGen and Abbott signed a worldwide sales and marketing agreement for rubitecan. Under the terms of the agreement, Abbott had exclusive distribution and promotion rights for rubitecan outside the US, and co-promotion rights with SuperGen within the US. In return, Abbott made an initial equity investment in SuperGen. SuperGen and Abbott Laboratories ended their collaboration agreement in February 2002 by mutual consent with SuperGen stating that the dissolution of the agreement was based on commercial motivation rather than anything to do with rubitecan's safety or efficacy. Abbott no longer has rights or obligations to purchase shares of SuperGen stock or an option to purchase up to 49% of the company. For its part, SuperGen will no longer receive milestone payments worth up to $US57 million. SuperGen has formed a clinical and business alliance with US Oncology (created by the merger between American Oncology Resources and Physician Reliance Network in the US), and will collaborate on clinical trials of rubitecan. SuperGen believes that this relationship will increase the patient population available for trials and enable it to market the drug directly to Oncologists. SuperGen and Capital Research and Management Company have completed a $US16.6 million private placement transaction that will enable future funding for the rubitecan programme as well as other oncology programmes. In July 2004, SuperGen's European subsidiary, EuroGen Pharmaceuticals, submitted a Marketing Authorisation Application for rubitecan in the treatment of pancreatic cancer. The application will be reviewed under the EMEA Centralised Procedure. In June 2003, the EMEA granted SuperGen orphan drug status for rubitecan for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. The US FDA has also granted orphan drug status for rubitecan in the treatment of pancreatic cancer and fast-track status for rubitecan for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer that is resistant or refractory to chemotherapy. SuperGen has conducted three phase III pivotal trials in patients with pancreatic cancer. A phase III randomised trial in chemotherapy-naive patients was conducted at 132 centres throughout the US. The trial enrolled approximately 994 patients who were randomised to receive rubitecan or gemcitabine. Enrollment was completed in October 2001. Another phase III trial has compared rubitecan with the most appropriate chemotherapy in chemotherapy-resistant patients. Enrollment of over 400 patients at 200 medical centres across the US was completed in June 2001. Results from the trial were presented at the 39th Annual Meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO-2003) [Chicago, US; 31 May - 3 June 2003], after they had been compiled, analysed and submitted to the FDA. The results of the study showed that rubitecan could not help all chemotherapy-resistant patients, but could increase survival in those that do respond. The other phase III pivotal trial was conducted in patients with pancreatic cancer who had failed treatment with gemcitabine. This trial completed enrollment in October 2001, and had enrolled approximately 448 patients. SuperGen is conducting phase II trials of rubitecan in patients with solid tumours in the UK, Italy, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Denmark. Each trial will enroll 100-150 patients with various tumour types, including colorectal, lung, breast, gastric, prostate, cervical and head and neck cancers. Phase I/II trials are underway to investigate rubitecan as a radiosensitiser in patients with lung cancer, and phase II trials in patients with breast cancer are also being conducted. A phase II study in ovarian cancer patients is also being conducted. Results from an ongoing phase II study in cancer patients have shown that rubitecan was effective against chordomas, a rare type of bone cancer. Phase II studies are also underway in haematological malignancies including myelodysplastic syndrome (preleukaemia) and chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia. In February 2000, SuperGen announced that its IND submission for rubitecan had been approved by the Therapeutics Products Programme of Canada. The company stated that it intended to begin clinical trials in Canada in the near future. In February 2004, SuperGen announced an offering of shares of its common stock to finance the commercialisation of rubitecan capsules. In July 2003, SuperGen was granted a US patent covering combination therapies with chemotherapeutic anthracycline agents and structural modifications that may one day lead to next-generation rubitecan compounds. In December 2002, SuperGen was granted US patent No. 6,482,830, covering its polymorphic formulations of rubitecan. The patent also covers a class of polymorphs that are similar to the one at the centre of rubitecan. In addition, SuperGen was also issued US patent No. 6,485,514 in December 2002, covering the local delivery of rubitecan via stents and/or catheters to sites of proliferating cells. Stent- or catheter-delivered rubitecan may be beneficial in certain types of cardiac procedures, such as ablation or angioplasty, as well as for direct injection into a certain number of solid tumours. SuperGen is also developing an inhaled, liposomal formulation of rubitecan. It acquired the worldwide rights to this formulation from the Clayton Foundation in December 1999. Inhaled rubitecan is in clinical trials in the US for the treatment of lung cancer and pulmonary metastatic cancer","","","","","","557 [pii]","","PM:15357630","","","",""

The drug is being developed by PharmaMar (Zeltia) in partnership with Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceutical Research & Development LLC. It was synthetically isolated and developed by the University of Illinois and licensed to PharmaMar; the company has completed the hemisynthesis of agent. Trabectedin interacts with the minor groove of DNA and alkylates guanine at the N2 position, which bends towards the major groove. In this manner, it is thought that the drug affects various transcription factors involved in cell proliferation, particularly via the transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair system. Trabectedin blocks the cell cycle at the G(2) phase, while cells at the G(1 )phase are most sensitive to the drug. It also inhibits overexpression of the multidrug resistance-1 gene (MDR-1) coding for the P-glycoprotein that is a major factor responsible for cells developing resistance to cancer drugs. The agent is also thought to interfere with the nucleotide excision repair pathways of cancer cells, suggesting that it could be effective in the treatment of many cancer types including melanoma and sarcoma, as well as lung, breast, ovarian, endometrial and prostate cancers; clinical evaluations are underway in these indications. PharmaMar and Ortho Biotech Products (Johnson & Johnson) entered into an agreement in August 2001 for the joint development and commercialisation of trabectedin. PharmaMar retains commercialisation rights in Europe, including Eastern Europe. Ortho Biotech will market the product in the US, Japan and the rest of the world; Tibotec Therapeutics (a division of Ortho Biotech) will commercialise it in the US. PharmaMar will receive an initial payment from Ortho Biotech plus future milestone and royalty payments linked to development targets and sales; the upfront payment would be approximately 20 million US dollars with royalties contributing 10-20% of total sales of the drug. Although details of the licensing transaction for trabectedin were undisclosed, analysts estimate the figure to be around 100 million US dollars. Previously, PharmaMar signed an agreement granting Bristol-Myers Squibb the option to evaluate and develop as many as 12 of PharmaMar's marine-derived anticancer compounds on an exclusive worldwide basis. However, it appears that Bristol-Myers Squibb had chosen not to exercise the option. Trabectedin is undergoing clinical trials in soft tissue sarcoma (Sarcoma in the Phase table), ovarian, breast, endometrial, prostate and non-small-cell lung cancers. PharmaMar indicated in January 2004 that it intends to launch trabectedin in one of these indications in 2006. PharmaMar raised funds from a round of financing in June 2005 that will be used to fund further clinical trials of its anticancer products, including trabectedin. The US FDA granted trabectedin orphan drug status for ovarian cancer in April 2005. Trabectedin also received orphan drug status from the European Commission for the treatment of ovarian cancer in October 2003. This followed a positive opinion by the Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products (COMP) of the EMEA. Trabectedin has undergone a phase II study for the second- or third-line treatment of ovarian cancer in Europe (England and Belgium), the US and Canada. The trial was initiated in October 2002 and evaluated a weekly schedule of trabectedin (0.58 mg/m(2)) via IV infusion for 3 weeks followed by a week of rest. Final results from this study have been presented. A separate phase II trial evaluating the antitumour activity of trabectedin as a second-line therapy in advanced ovarian cancer was conducted by researchers at the Southern Europe New Drugs Organization (SENDO) in Milan, Italy. PharmaMar and Johnson & Johnson are conducting a pivotal (STS-201) trial to compare a weekly and daily dosing regimen of trabectedin among patients with advanced or metastatic soft tissue sarcoma who are unresponsive to standard chemotherapy of doxorubicin and ifosfamide. The randomised, multicentre, open-label trial has completed enrolment of 270 patients during the second quarter of 2005. Positive data from the STS-201 trial have been announced. An independent data monitoring committee has found that interim data supports a positive trend in time to disease progression favouring patients receiving the daily dosing regimen. Consequently, all patients have been offered the option of switching to the daily regimen. Final results from the STS-201 trial will form the basis of MAA re-submission with European regulatory authorities. PharmaMar has held a pre-submission meeting with the EMEA and has presented a formal letter of intent to file for approval of trabectedin for soft tissue sarcoma. Previously, PharmaMar first filed for EU registration of trabectedin for treatment of advanced soft tissue sarcoma in November 2001, which was accepted for review by the EMEA and Swiss Health Authorities. However, the CPMP confirmed its recommendation not to grant trabectedin marketing authorisation in November 2003 following PharmaMar's appeal against the CPMP's negative opinion first announced in July 2003; the opinion was adopted by a majority vote rather than by consensus. Trabectedin was granted orphan drug status in Europe for recurrent soft tissue sarcoma in 2001. It was also granted orphan drug status by the FDA for the same indication in October 2004. Phase I studies are being conducted to evaluate trabectedin in combination with doxorubicin and liposomal doxorubicin for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma. PharmaMar is also conducting a phase I study of sequential paclitaxel followed by trabectedin in patients with soft tissue sarcoma. At additional dose levels, patients with other tumour types will be enrolled to assess the antitumour activity of the combination. The US NCI has approved and is partially funding a phase I clinical programme to determine the feasibility of using trabectedin to treat children with soft tissue sarcoma and bone sarcoma who are resistant to conventional therapies. PharmaMar has reported that trabectedin can be safely administered to children at doses up to 1100mg given as a 3-hour infusion, and that this dose will be used in further paediatric studies. Trabectedin has completed phase II studies for small round cell sarcoma and rhabdomyosarcoma, which are aggressive tumours occurring predominantly in children. A phase II study evaluating two dosing schedules of trabectedin has been conducted in patients with leiomyosarcomas or liposarcomas refractory to standard doxorubicin + ifosfamide chemotherapy. The study was conducted in Australia, Canada, Russia and the US","","","","","","755 [pii]","","PM:16922593","","","",""

Management of bone health in patients with malignant bone disease from breast cancer, prostate cancer, lung cancer, and multiple myeloma was discussed in clinical case workshops held during the ZENITH meeting (April 2007, Prague, Czech Republic). Physicians in attendance were generally in agreement that bisphosphonate therapy is recommended for treatment of bone metastases and that treatment should be sustained over the duration of disease progression. Consensus is still evolving regarding the optimal duration of therapy and the emerging role of bisphosphonates in the management of bone loss in the adjuvant setting. Bisphosphonates have proven efficacy in reducing and delaying skeletal-related events in patients with bone metastases, and play a key role in preserving patient functional independence and quality of life. Furthermore, bisphosphonate therapy is a cost-effective strategy in the care of patients with bone metastases compared with the cost of treatment for fractures and other skeletal complications. Finally, communication with patients is critical to increase awareness of the benefits of bisphosphonate therapy. Increased patient involvement with treatment decisions will likely encourage patient compliance and thereby maximize clinical benefit from bisphosphonate therapy","","","","","","S0093-7754(07)00204-7 [pii];10.1053/j.seminoncol.2007.10.002 [doi]","Institut Multidisciplinaire d'Oncologie Clinique de Genolier, Genolier, Switzerland. maapro@genolier.net","PM:18068488","","","",""

All 16 patients treated from 1997 to 2000 were entered in the study. All patients initially received radical irradiation via either external beam or brachytherapy (66 to 70 Gy), but one patient received a 30-Gy radiation dose for seminoma. The second course was a radical dose using brachytherapy, teletherapy, or both. Both courses were tolerated well. The rectal dose from brachytherapy was roughly half the dose to the periphery of the prostate. No rectal complications due to reirradiation were noted during the follow-up. Urinary symptoms occurred in six (37.5%) of 16 patients and were relieved by conservative methods. Two patients (12.5%) developed evidence of local recurrence after the second course of irradiation; one of these two was treated by pelvic exenteration with no further evidence of cancer; the other was treated by hormones and was alive and well. One patient had bone metastasis and was the only patient who received no brachytherapy. After the second course of irradiation, 13 (81%) of 16 patients showed no evidence of cancer, with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels dropping in 12 patients, while one patient died of a myocardial infarction before PSA evaluation. We concluded that in patients who tolerated well a full dose of irradiation to the prostate, reirradiation with a carefully delivered radical dose is feasible and worth considering. There were no rectal complications attributable to reirradiation during the follow-up. The cancer control rate was 81%, and the urinary complication rate was 37% but controlled by conservative treatment. Longer follow-up is recommended to detect possible late failures or complications. It is advisable that reirradiation is done only by an experienced radiation oncologist","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Endothelin-1, which is produced by prostate cancer cells, can stimulate new bone formation. It can also act synergistically with a number of growth factors promoting cancer cells growth and proliferation. Over-expression of endothelin-1 and diminished capacity for its clearance have been seen in prostate cancer cell lines. The highest concentration of endothelin-1 is found in patients with hormone refractory metastatic disease. Atrasentan (Xinlay, Abbott) is a member of a new class of drugs called the selective endothelin-A receptor antagonists (SERAs). The safety and efficacy of atrasentan in hormone refractory prostate cancer (HRPC) have been evaluated in several clinical trials. Atrasentan demonstrated some efficacy in delaying the progression of disease and improving patients' quality of life while having an acceptable safety profile. An NDA for atrasentan was submitted in December 2004 for the treatment of patients with HRPC metastatic to bone. A response from FDA is anticipated later this year","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The findings of the group were that immediate hormonal therapy does not provide an overall survival advantage in localised and locally advanced prostate cancer. Bicalutamide can prolong disease free survival in patients with locally advanced prostate cancer, however it is important to underline that at this time it has not been shown to influence disease specific nor overall survival. It remains also unproven that early treatment is superior to treatment at progression. However, a trend towards decreased survival with bicalutamide was observed in low risk patients such as those with localised disease. In patients receiving bicalutamide, there were increased cardiovascular side-effects, in addition to the high incidence of gynaecomastia. Early hormonal therapy has to be balanced against such side-effects and the inevitable appearance of hormone refractory disease in patients who progress after hormonal therapy. Consequently, patients with localised, low risk disease are not considered appropriate candidates for hormonal therapy used either as mono-therapy or in the adjuvant setting. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

We systematically reviewed the published evidence for these tests. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched MEDLINE for articles on these investigations in newly diagnosed cases of prostate cancer. Data were pooled based on prostate specific antigen (PSA), grade and tumor stage. RESULTS: Among 23 studies examining the role of bone scan metastases were detected in 2.3%, 5.3% and 16.2% of patients with PSA levels less than 10, 10.1 to 19.9 and 20 to 49.9 ng/ml, respectively. Scanning detected metastases in 6.4% of men with organ confined cancer and 49.5% with locally advanced disease. Detection rates were 5.6% and 29.9% for Gleason scores 7 or less and 8 or greater, respectively. Among 25 studies CT documented lymphadenopathy in 0 and 1.1% of patients with PSA less than 20 and 20 ng/ml or greater, respectively. CT detection rate was 0.7% and 19.6% in patients with localized and locally advanced disease, respectively. Detection rates in patients with Gleason scores 7 or less and 8 or greater were 1.2% and 12.5%, respectively. These risks were typically much greater on pathological evaluation. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with low risk prostate cancer are unlikely to have metastatic disease documented by bone scan or CT. Therefore, these investigations should not be standard practice. However, patients with PSA 20 ng/ml or greater, locally advanced disease, or Gleason score 8 or greater are at higher risk for bone metastases and should be considered for bone scan. CT may be useful in patients with locally advanced disease or Gleason score 8 or greater but appears not to be of benefit in patients with increased PSA alone","","","","","","00005392-200406000-00006 [pii]","Kuwait Cancer Control Center, Kuwait City, Kuwait","PM:15126770","","","",""

The most frequent spinal metastases (60%) are from breast, lung, or prostate cancer. The chance that an elderly patient (60-79 years old) is affected by bony metastases is four times higher in men and three times higher in women than a middle-aged patient (40-59 years old). Since the medical treatment with all the adjuvant treatment options prolong the survival of this particular patient group, the spinal metastases may become a mechanical issue, thus requesting surgical treatment. Different classification systems have been proposed to rationalize surgical indications, some concentrating solely on the local spinal tumor involvement and some including the overall clinical situation. Since most of the surgical options are of palliative character, it is more important to base the decision on an overall clinical classification including the different treatment modalities-irradiation, chemotherapy, steroids, bisphosphonates, and surgery-to make a shared decision. In case surgery is indicated-neural compression, pathological fracture, instability, and progressive deformity, nursing reasons-the most straightforward procedures should be chosen, which may not need an intensive care unit stay. In the thoracolumbar spine a posterior decompression and posterolateral vertebral body resection through a posterior approach only, with a concomitant reconstruction and stabilization, has shown to work sufficiently well. In the middle and lower cervical spine the anterior approach with anterior decompression and anterior column reconstruction is most effective and has a low morbidity, whereas the occipitocervical junction can generally be treated by posterior resection and stabilization. The outcome should be determined by the survival time in an ambulatory, independent status, where pain is controlled, and the patient is not hospitalized. Surgical management shows the greatest improvement in pain reduction, but also in other domains of quality of life. Since prospective randomized studies comparing different treatment modalities for spinal metastases including surgery are not available and are ethically difficult to achieve, each case remains an interdisciplinary, shared decision making process for what is considered best for a patient or elderly patient. However, whenever surgery is an option, it should be planned before irradiation since surgery after irradiation has a significant higher complication rate","","","","","","10.1007/s00586-003-0609-9 [doi]","Institute for Evaluative Research in Orthopedic Surgery, University of Berne, Murtenstrasse 35, P.O.

METHODS: 205 patients with previously untreated stage C/D prostate cancer were randomized (1:1) to receive once-daily bicalutamide 80 mg or placebo, each combined with a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist. Primary study variables were the 12 week prostate-specific antigen (PSA) normalization (i.e. PSA level <or=4 ng/ml) rate, the 12 week overall tumor response rate (proportion with a partial response or better) and the proportion of withdrawals due to adverse drug reactions (ADRs) at follow-up. This interim analysis was undertaken after a minimum of 6 months' follow-up (median 15 months). RESULTS: The 12 week PSA normalization rate was 79.4% for MAB and 38.6% for LHRH agonist monotherapy (P < 0.001). The 12 week overall tumor response rate was 77.5 and 65.3%, respectively (P = 0.063). The withdrawal rate due to ADRs was 8.8% and 10.9%, respectively. There were differences in favor of MAB over monotherapy with respect to time to treatment failure (TTTF) (P = 0.038) and time to progression (TTP) (P = 0.016). There have been too few deaths (n = 10) to analyze survival. The profiles of adverse events and ADRs were broadly similar in the two treatment groups. CONCLUSION: In Japanese patients with advanced prostate cancer, first-line treatment with bicalutamide 80 mg in combination with an LHRH agonist is superior to LHRH agonist monotherapy in terms of the antitumor response at 12 weeks, and also time to treatment failure and progression, and does not compromise treatment safety.

Strontium-89 is a palliative agent that acts as a selective radiation source for bone metastasis. The combination of EMP, vinblastine, and strontium-89 was developed to exploit the potential for radiosynergy. PATIENTS AND METHODS Forty-four patients at the Brown Oncology Group affiliated hospitals were treated with oral EMP 600 mg/m2 daily on Weeks 1-4 and 7-10, vinblastine 4 mg/m2 intravenously once each week on Weeks 1-4 and 7-10, and strontium-89 2.2 MBq/kg on Day 1. Courses were repeated every 12 weeks. Response assessment was based on a change in the serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels, correlated with change in measurable disease and bone scan appearance. RESULTS: A greater than or equal to 50% decline in PSA for at least 6 weeks was observed in 21 patients (48%, 95% confidence interval, 33-62%). Median duration of response was 23 weeks (range, 6-70.8 weeks). The median survival was 13 months with 1- and 2-year survival rates of 55% and 25%, respectively. After completion of protocol therapy, a retrospective review showed that only nine patients received subsequent palliative external beam radiation after progression. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of strontium-89 to the regimen of EMP and vinblastine can be delivered safely and in repeated doses, provides effective palliation, and may decrease the need for future radiation therapy. A randomized trial is necessary to quantify these effects","","","","","","10.1002/cncr.10437 [pii]","Boston University Medical Center, Oncology-Hematology, Boston, Massachusetts 02118, USA.

Methods and materials Fifty-three patients who had developed localized hormone-refractory prostate cancer were treated with EBRT between 1994 and 2001. According to the 1992 American Joint Committee on Cancer clinical stage, 4 patients had T2 and 49 had T3 at the start of RT, and 14 patients had a Gleason score <7, 14 had a Gleason score of 7, and 23 had a Gleason score of 8-10. All patients were treated with EBRT using the unblocked oblique four-field technique, with a total dose of 69 Gy. The fraction dose was 3 Gy three times weekly. The median follow-up after RT was 35 months (range, 8-96 months) and after androgen ablation was 73 months (range, 42-156 months). Results Of 53 patients, 15 patients subsequently developed clinical relapse, including locoregional and/or distant metastases. The site of first relapse was bone metastasis in 10, lymph nodes in 3, and local failure in 2 patients; 3 patients died of prostate cancer during the analysis period. The 3-year and 5-year cause-specific survival rate was 94% and 87%, respectively, and the 3-year and 5-year clinical relapse-free survival rate was 78% and 56%, respectively. The univariate analysis revealed that a short prostate-specific antigen (PSA) doubling time and high PSA value at the start of RT and a high Gleason score were statistically significant factors for the risk of clinical relapse. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the PSA value (PSA <=15 vs. >=15 ng/mL) at the start of RT was an independent prognostic factor.

The treatment, however, decreases the influence of both androgens end estrogens on bone tissue and may result in bone mass loss and increased propensity to fractures. The purpose of the study was to determine the influence of complete androgenic blockade on bone mass and skeletal metabolism in men with advanced prostatic carcinoma and to assess whether 1alpha-OH vitamin D3 (1alpha-OHD3) together with calcium supplementation is able to prevent bone mass loss in men treated with complete androgenic blockade. 51 patients with advanced prostatic carcinoma, with skeletal metastases, aged 44 - 86, mean 68 ys were included into a 12-month prospective study. All patients were treated with orchidectomy followed by therapy with flutamide in a dose of 750 mg daily. 26 patients were additionally given 1alpha-OHD3 in a dose of 0.5 microg/d and calcium carbonate in an initial dose of 1 g daily. It was found that the 12-month treatment with complete androgenic blockade resulted in a decrease in bone mineral density (BMD) by 8.1% in the lumbar spine, by 6.3% in the femoral neck and by 3.5% in the total skeleton. Therapy with 1alpha-OHD3 and CaCO3 caused complete inhibition of bone tissue loss in the lumbar spine and resulted in an increase in BMD by 2.2% in femoral neck and by 1.9% in the total skeleton. None of the examined patients experienced any skeletal fractures. In both groups of patients a prompt decrease in serum alkaline phosphatase activity - a marker of osteoblast activity and an increase in fasting urine calcium creatinine ratio indicating acceleration of bone resorption were found. Conclusions: in patients with advanced prostatic carcinoma treated with complete androgenic blockade acceleration of bone mass loss is observed; treatment with 1alpha-OHD3 and CaCO3 is able to prevent both trabecular and compact bone loss","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Patients and Methods: In bone marrow aspirates of 34 patients with CaP and 11 control patients without CaP, CK18/PSA immunocytochemistry was performed and compared with PSA RT-PCR in bone marrow and blood. Results: 12% of tumors showed a positive staining with PSA and and 17% with CK18 immunocytochemistry. There was no correlation with the stage or grade of the CaP. False positive results occurred in 2 out of 6 males without CaP and in 2 out of 5 women. 35% of the samples were found to have PSA-mRNA signals in RT-PCR which were neither associated with the histological stage or grade nor the PSA staining in immunocytochemistry. Conclusion: False positive staining results were obtained in control patients. Detection of PSA-mRNA was not associated with immunocytochemistry. Neither immunocytochemical nor PCR results were associated with the histological stage of the CaP. Thus, detection of micrometastasis using immunocytochemical methods has to be interpreted with caution and cannot be recommended as a clinical staging procedure","","","","","","","","","","","",""

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective, population based survey was conducted on 3,690 men with prostate cancer diagnosed between October 1, 1994 and October 31, 1995. Cases were identified by the rapid case ascertainment systems used in 6 geographic regions participating in the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Program. Based on information captured in primary medical record reviews we estimated the positive yield of bone scans, computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS: The positive yield of bone scan and CT was less than 5% and 12%, respectively, for all men with prostate specific antigen (PSA) 4 to 20 ng./ml., and less than 2% and 9%, respectively, for those who also had a Gleason score of 6 or less. Only men with PSA greater than 50 ng./ml. and those with Gleason scores 8 to 10 and PSA greater than 20 ng./ml. had positive yields greater than 10% and 20% for bone scan and CT, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Imaging studies designed to identify metastases and/or extracapsular extension in men with newly diagnosed prostate cancer frequently have a low positive yield. Wide variations exist in the use of imaging studies and are associated with tumor factors, such as Gleason score and serum PSA, and nontumor factors, such as state of residence. More extensive cost-effectiveness analyses are needed to define appropriate guidelines for ordering imaging studies to optimize the positive yield among men with newly diagnosed prostate cancer","","","","","","S0022-5347(05)67710-5 [pii]","Division of Urology, University of Connecticut Health Center, Farmington, USA","PM:10737483","","","",""

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In all, 48 patients were included with a mean age of 70.4 years and Gleason score of 7.5, all had a satisfactory Karnofsky performance-status score of 92% and a metastatic bone site was measurable in 77%. The mean delay between initial diagnosis and docetaxel administration was 45 months, with a median PSA level increase of 54.8 ng/mL. The therapeutic schedule was: docetaxel (50 mg/m(2)) administered every 14 days (one cycle of two injections at 2 week intervals (Day 1 = Day 28) with a total of six cycles) and simultaneously a daily oral fixed dose of celecoxib (800 mg). RESULTS: In all, 237 cycles of docetaxel were administered with a dose reduction in 23 patients at the beginning of a cycle (day 1) and 36 in the middle of a cycle (day 14). The haematological toxicity included anaemia grade 1-2 (78%) and only 10% neutropenia grade 3-4. However, there was only a 15% improvement of pain intensity. The response rate for the total PSA level was 45.5 (30.4-61.1)%, the mean time to progression was 9.3 months and the tumour-response rate was 26.3%. In all, 75% of patients had an overall survival of >14.6 months.

Methods: 107 patients (median follow-up 92 weeks) were treated with MAB until a PSA nadir was reached. Nadir was defined as PSA below 20 ng/ml corresponding to PSA reduction by at least 80% of baseline value. Criteria for restarting treatment was PSA > 20 ng/ml and PSA > nadir + 50%. Trials aim was to assess the likelihood that 80% of patients would reach a first nadir and that 80% of these would also reach a second n adir. Results: 51.4% of patients had some degree of pain at entry, 27.1% had > 15 hot spots, 23.7% demonstrated obstruction. Only 17.8% had normal potency, 56.1% were totally impotent. One to seven cycles of treatment were given. 76.6% of patients reached a 1st nadir after a median of 19 weeks of treatment, 84.1% of these started the 2nd cycle and 71% of them reached a 2nd nadir after a median of 13.6 weeks. Median time off-treatment was 14.3 and 16.0 weeks corresponding to 38.4% and 48.5% of the duration of each cycle. A similar proportion of patients was reported to be potent during follow-up compared to baseline. 32.7% of patients died during follow-up, 82.9% o f prostate cancer. Conclusion: Around 75 % of the patients achieved a nadir at each cycle. The concept of IAS seems to be feasible and warrants further investigation. (c) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Androgen deprivation therapy is effective in reducing painful bony metastases and soft tissue visceral disease in advanced-stage prostate cancer. The use of ADT has expanded beyond the metastatic setting and can also be used as adjuvant therapy for patients with locally advanced prostate cancer who received surgery or localized radiation therapy. Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists are the most common medical therapy used to deprive men of androgen production. Despite the beneficial effects that ADT has on prostate cancer, ADT causes side effects that can impair quality of life.

The current article is based on a literature review regarding the prognostic factors and medical treatments, with a focus on recent advances in chemotherapy. With the use of docetaxel that increases the median survival of this disease and improves the symptoms, new clinical protocols have been developed, with promising results; these protocols propose a combination with calcitriol or antiangiogenic agents. Supportive care is also an important part of the treatment due to the high level of bone involvement and its consequences. Such recent advances constitute a real progress in the management of prostate cancer, namely the pharmacological combinations with a promising efficacy and little toxicity","","","","","","","Service d'oncologie medicale, groupe hospitalier Pitie-Salpetriere, Assistance Publique, Hopitaux de Paris, 41-87, boulevard de l'Hopital, 75013 Paris, France","PM:17486912","","","",""

A spectrum of disease states exists and management is tailored to individual patients. Increasing public awareness and prostate-specific antigen testing have led to earlier detection and the possibility of cure but have increased the risk of overtreatment of indolent disease. Advances in curative modalities have reduced side effects and offer patients a choice of treatments. Nonetheless, many need no intervention and may be safely treated with active monitoring. Choice and timing of therapy for locally advanced and recurrent disease are variable, with potential benefits of early intervention counterbalanced by side effects of treatment. Progress has been made in the management of advanced disease; skeletal-related events have been reduced and survival has been increased. This review examines the evidence and rationale behind the treatment options from curative intent to management of locally advanced disease and palliation of metastatic disease.

Balanced against possible survival benefits and better disease control are data that ADT adversely affects quality of life, particularly in the areas of sexual function, physical function, and energy. There is some evidence of worsening upper extremity physical strength but no clear evidence of decline in daily function with ADT. The impact of ADT on cognitive function is not clear at this time. ADT is associated with declines in bone mineral density within 6-12 months of commencing treatment, with increased fracture rates within 5 years of treatment. ADT use is also associated with a 10-15g/L decline in hemoglobin, although the clinical significance of this drop appears to be limited for most patients. It is reasonable for physicians who are about to start men on ADT to obtain a baseline bone mineral density, to counsel them about the impact on sexual function and possible treatments for sexual dysfunction, and to encourage regular exercise. Further insight into adverse effects of ADT and strategies to minimize these adverse effects await data from ongoing studies","","","","","","S1040-8428(06)00114-4 [pii];10.1016/j.critrevonc.2006.06.006 [doi]","Division of General Internal Medicine & Clinical Epidemiology, University Health Network, Toronto, Canada. shabbir.alibhai@uhn.on.ca","PM:16860998","","","",""

A major proportion of the morbidity and mortality related to prostate cancer can be traced to the burden of bone metastases. The optimal management of bone health in men with prostate cancer requires control of the underlying epithelial neoplasm, attenuation of the subverted bone remodeling process that accompanies disease progression, reduction in the bone complications of disease-directed therapy, and management of co-ex isting comorbidities that enhance bone fragility. While bone-homing radioisotopes, bisphosphonates, and RANK ligand inhibitors have demonstrated reduction in bone pain and/or other skeletal-related events, further advances into definitive improvements in survival and/or global quality of life are required. A deeper understanding of the biology of bone metastases will likely facilitate a bone-directed therapeutic approach toward a major impact on the survival of men with this important disease.

Alpha emitting radioisotopes such as Bi-212, Bi-213, At-211 and Ac-225 are used to label monoclonal antibodies or proteins that target specific cancer cells. Alternatively, radium-233 is used for palliative therapy of breast and prostate cancers as it is a bone seeking element.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the prognostic value of different forms of the urokinase receptor, uPAR, in serum from prostate cancer (PC) patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS. The uPAR forms were measured in samples from 131 metastatic PC patients. These constituted a subset of patients included in a randomized clinical trial of treatment with total androgen blockade (TAB) versus polyestradiol phosphate (PEP). Pre-treatment serum levels of intact uPAR (uPAR(I-III)), intact plus cleaved uPAR (uPAR(I-III)+uPAR(II-III) ) and domain I (uPAR(I)) were measured using time-resolved fluorescence immunoassays (TR-FIAs). RESULTS. High serum levels of each of the uPAR forms were significantly associated with short overall survival (OS). The prognostic impact was strongest in the TAB treated patients with all uPAR forms being statistically significant. In multivariate analysis, uPAR(I-III)+uPAR(II-III) was an independent prognostic factor inTABtreated patients (HR=5.2, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.5-10.6, P<0.0001) but not in PEP treated patients (P=0.40). In the entire study population, OS was similar in the two treatment groups. The survival analysis showed significant interactions between treatment modality and the level of either uPAR(I-III) or uPAR(I-III)+uPAR(II-III). High levels of uPAR(I-III)+uPAR(II-III) were found to be predictive of effect of PEP versus TAB treatment. Patients with uPAR(I-III)+uPAR(II-III) levels above the median had significantly longer OS (median difference 11.3 months), if treated with PEP rather than with TAB (HR=1.8, 95% CI:1.1-3.1, P=0.03). CONCLUSION. uPAR forms are significantly associated with OS. High uPAR(I-III)+ uPAR(II-III) predicts longer OS in patients treated with PEP compared to TAB. uPAR forms are promising prognostic and predictive markers in PC. 2011.

Following surgical castration being the most common form of androgen deprivation, 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone is still present in prostate cancer tissue. Therefore, a maximal androgen blockade (MAB) consisting of a chemical or surgical castration plus a pure or antigonadotropic antiandrogen, has been proposed. Indeed, MAB lowers the dihydrotestosterone-androgen-receptor complex and suppresses the growth-factor dominated signal transduction. This leads to a measurable increase of apoptosis. New is the finding that LHRH as well as LH (for example following surgical castration) are bound by receptors located at the prostate cancer cell. In 30 phase-III trials, MAB has been tested against monotherapy and a cancer-specific survival advantage of 3 to 6 months and a approximately 6-month delay of progression was demonstrated. The most effective form of MAB is the combination of a LHRH agonist - in contrast to surgical castration - with a well-tolerated pure antiandrogen. The quality of life during MAB is low, if a pure antiandrogen such as flutamide is used which leads to rather serious side-effects. At the present time, special indications for MAB are patients with minimal metastases, bone pain at the time of diagnosis, a neoadjuvant or adjuvant application in combination with a radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy and particularly intermittent androgen deprivation which is tested at the present time in at least 5 international studies. An endocrine withdrawal syndrome is observed in approximately 30 % of patients, if, following a PSA-relapse, the antiandrogen is discontinued. Little notice has been given to the use of prognosticators for the decision, whether a MAB is useful or not. Patients with good prognostic factors as defined by Sylvester have a clear advantage, if MAB is compared to monotherapy, whereas patients with a pure prognosis did not benefit. In addition to these prognostic factors up-front, the PSA dynamics under an initial MAB may be employed for the decision, if this form of androgen deprivation is to be continued or not. In essence, in contrast to a general use of MAB a more differential application based on quality-of-life issues and prognosis should be preferred","","","","","","00390027.120 [pii]","Urologische Abteilung, Krankenhaus der Barmherzigen Bruder, Munchen-Nymphenburg","PM:10663193","","","",""

We conducted a phase II study of Cilengitide, a selective antagonist of alpha(v)beta(3) and alpha(v)beta(5) integrins, in non-metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer with rising PSA. Methods: Patients were observed for 4 weeks with PSA monitoring, and then treated with 2,000 mg IV of cilengitide twice weekly until toxicity/progression. PSA, circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and circulating endothelial cells (CECs) were monitored each cycle with imaging performed every three cycles. Primary end point was PSA decline by >/=50%. Secondary endpoints were safety, PSA slope, time to progression (TTP), overall survival (OS), CTCs, CECs and gene expression. Results: 16 pts were enrolled; 13 were eligible with median age 65.5 years, baseline PSA 8.4 ng/mL and median Gleason sum 7. Median of three cycles was administered. Treatment was well tolerated with two grade three toxicities and no grade four toxicities. There were no PSA responses; 11 patients progressed by PSA after three cycles. Median TTP was 1.8 months and median OS has not been reached. Median pre- and on-treatment PSA slopes were 1.1 and 1.8 ng/mL/month. Baseline CTCs were detected in 1/9 patients. CTC increased (0 to 1; 2 pts), remained at 0 (2 pts) or decreased (23 to 0; 1 patient) at progression. Baseline median CEC was 26 (0-61) and at progression, 47 (15-148). Low cell counts precluded gene expression studies. Conclusions: Cilengitide was well tolerated but had no detectable clinical activity.

This phase II study investigated the addition of Sr-89 to an alternating weekly regimen of doxorubicin and ketoconazole with paclitaxel and estramustine in patients with progressive prostate cancer and bone involvement. METHODS: Twenty-nine patients with progressive adenocarcinoma of the prostate and osteoblastic bone metastases who failed conventional hormonal therapy were registered for the study. Of those, 27 were treated with Sr-89 on day 1 of week 1. On weeks 1, 3, and 5, patients received doxorubicin (20 mg/m on day 1) and oral ketoconazole (400 mg 3 times a day for 7 days). On weeks 2, 4, and 6, patients received paclitaxel (100 mg/m(2)) and oral estramustine (280 mg 3 times a day for 7 days). No treatment was given during weeks 7 and 8. Cycles were repeated every 8 weeks. RESULTS: A > or =50% reduction in prostate-specific antigen level was maintained for at least 8 weeks in 77.7% of the patients (21 patients) at 16 weeks and in 66.6% (18 patients) at 32 weeks. The median progression-free survival was 11.27 months (range, 1.83-29.53), and the median overall survival was 22.67 months (1.83-57.73+). Two patients died during study because of disease progression. Overall, the chemotherapy combined with Sr-89 was well tolerated.

The comparative safety and immunologic and clinical efficacy of TroVax alone or in combination with GM-CSF was determined. Twenty-seven patients with metastatic hormone refractory prostate cancer were treated with TroVax alone (n=14) or TroVax+GM-CSF (n=13). 5T4-specific cellular and humoral responses were monitored throughout the study. Clinical responses were assessed by quantifying prostate-specific antigen concentrations and measuring changes in tumor burden by computer-assisted tomography scan. TroVax was well tolerated in all patients with no serious adverse events attributed to vaccination. Of 24 immunologically evaluable patients, all mounted 5T4-specific antibody responses. Periods of disease stabilization from 2 to >10 months were observed. Time to progression was significantly greater in patients who mounted 5T4-specific cellular responses compared with those who did not (5.6 vs. 2.3 mo, respectively). There were no objective clinical responses seen in this study. In this study, the combination of GM-CSF with TroVax showed similar clinical and immunologic responses to TroVax alone. The high frequency of 5T4-specific immune responses and relationship with enhanced time to progression is encouraging and warrants further investigation. copyright 2008 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

Association of PPARgamma with repressing factors or posttranslational modifications in PPARy protein could explain the lack of effect of PPARgamma ligands in a recent randomized clinical trial. Using cells and prostate cancer xenograft mouse models, we demonstrate in this study that a combination treatment using the PPARgamma agonist pioglitazone and the histone deacetylase inhibitor valproic acid is more efficient at inhibiting prostate tumor growth than each ind ividual therapy. We show that the combination treatment impairs the bone-invasive potential of prostate cancer cells in mice. In addition, we demonstrate that expression of E-cadherin, a protein involved in the control of cell migration and invasion, is highly up-regulated in the presence of valproic acid and pioglitazone. We show that E-cadherin expression responds only to the combination treatment and not to single PPARgamma agonists, defining a new class of PPARgamma target genes. These results open up new therapeutic perspectives in the treatment of prostate cancer. Copyright (c) 2006, American Society for Microbiology.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-four patients with histologically confirmed metastatic prostatic cancer (M1b or D2) and a performance status of 0-2 (World Health Organization) were entered into the trial between March 2000 and June 2002. The trial comprised two treatment arms, i.e. patients were randomized to orchidectomy alone or orchidectomy plus lycopene (OL), each of 27 patients. Lycopene was started on the day of orchidectomy at 2 mg twice daily. Patients were evaluated clinically before and every 3 months after the intervention, with measurements of prostate-specific antigen (PSA), a bone scan and uroflowmetry, with the clinical response assessed as the change in these variables. RESULTS: At 6 months there was a significant reduction in PSA level in both treatments, but more marked in the OL group (mean 9.1 and 26.4 ng/mL, P = 0.9). After 2 years these changes were more consistent in the OL group (mean 3.01 and 9.02 ng/mL; P < 0.001). Eleven (40%) patients in orchidectomy and 21 (78%) in the OL group had a complete PSA response (P < 0.05), with a partial response in nine (33%) and four (15%), and progression in seven (25%) and two (7%), respectively (P < 0.05). Bone scans showed that in the orchidectomy arm only four (15%) patients had a complete response, vs eight (30%) in the OL group (P < 0.02), with a partial response in 19 (70%) and 17 (63%), and progression in four (15%) and two (7%), respectively (P < 0.02). There was a significant improvement in peak flow rate in the OL group, with a mean difference of +1.17 mL/s (P < 0.04). Of the 54 patients who entered the trial, 19 (35%) died, 12 (22%) in orchidectomy and seven (13%) in OL group (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Adding lycopene to orchidectomy produced a more reliable and consistent decrease in serum PSA level; it not only shrinks the primary tumour but also diminishes the secondary tumours, providing better relief from bone pain and lower urinary tract symptoms, and improving survival compared with orchidectomy alone","","","","","","4370 [pii]","Department of Urology, All India Institute of Medical Science, New Delhi, India","PM:12930422","","","",""

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was initiated on 1 July 1997 and closed after enrolling 100 patients on 30 June 2000. Patients were prospectively randomized to orchiectomy alone (O) and orchiectomy plus flutamide (OF). A complete response (CR) was defined as the normalization of bone scans and serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels returning to normal (< 4 ng/mL). A partial response (PR) was defined as a 50% reduction in metastasis mass compared to the initial study or a decrease in the PSA level of 50% of the initial value. Progressive disease (PD) was defined as the development of any new hot spot on bone scan or any increase in previously existing PSA level by 25%. RESULTS: A total of 100 patients were entered in the study. The maximum percentage change in PSA levels in both groups was found in the first 3 months after orchiectomy, that is, 95% and 97% for the O and OF groups, respectively. In more than 80% of the patients this decrease in PSA was maintained for 3 years. The mean percentage change at 3 years in the O and OF groups was 70% and 75% (P = 0.95), respectively, and the overall response rate (CR + PR) was 88.50% and 86.53% in the two groups, respectively (P = 0.85). The follow-up period ranged between 3 and 5 years (mean, 3.5 years). The mean time to progression was 27 and 29 months in the O and OF groups, respectively. The overall survival rate at 3 and 5 years in two treatment groups was 45.83% and 48.07%, 20.83% and 23.07% in the O and OF groups, respectively (P = 0.75). CONCLUSIONS: Maximum percentage decrease in PSA is seen within the first 3 months of therapy. Orchiectomy alone is as effective as combination therapy in decreasing serum PSA. Overall survival at 3 and 5 years in the orchiectomy only group was as good as that of combination therapy. These data suggest that the routine addition of flutamide to orchiectomy is not advisable","","","","","","IJU953 [pii];10.1111/j.1442-2042.2004.00953.x [doi]","Department of Urology, All India Institute of Medical Science, New Delhi, India","PM:15663681","","","",""

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between January 2001 and December 2002, 20 consecutive patients (median age 72; range 56-90) with metastatic HRPC were enrolled in the study. Lycopene in the dose of 10 mg/day was administered for a period of 3 months. Inclusion criteria were patients previously treated with hormonal therapy now with clinical and biochemical evidence of disease progression. A complete response (CR) was defined as a normalization of PSA (<4 ng/mL) and the disappearance of any sign of disease for at least 8 weeks. A partial response was defined as a >50% decrease in PSA level for at least 8 weeks associated with improvement (or no worsening) in ECOG PS and relief of bone pain if present. Stable disease (SD) was defined as a <50% decrease or <25% increase in the PSA level associated with no worsening of ECOG PS and/or bone pain for at least 8 weeks. RESULTS: One patient (5%) had complete response. Partial response was achieved in 6 (30%), disease remained stable in 10 (50%) and progressed in three (15%) patients. ECOG PS was Grade 0 in five, Grade I in 10 and Grade II in five of the 20 patients. It improved from Grade I to 0 in seven and Grade II to I in three patients. It deteriorated in three and remained unchanged in the rest seven patients. Bone pain was present in 16 (Grade 1 in six and Grade 2 in 10) of the 20 patients. Grade 1 changed to Grade 0 in five and Grade II changed to Grade 1 in five patients. Bone pain remained unchanged in 5 (31%) and worsened in 1 (6%). Ten (62%) patients managed to cut down the dose of analgesics on daily basis. Eighteen patients had associated LUTS, which improved (Q max > or = 12 mL/sec) in 11 (61%) patients. The median duration of response was 25 weeks (range 12-72 weeks). No drug intolerance or toxicity was encountered in any patient. CONCLUSIONS: Lycopene therapy appears to be effective and safe in the treatment of HRPC. It not only takes care of the rising PSA but also improves the ECOG performance status, bone pain and LUTS. Because of its relative innocuousness it should be tried before the use of more toxic substances","","","","","","S1078-1439(04)00122-X [pii];10.1016/j.urolonc.2004.05.009 [doi]","Department of Urology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi 110029, India. ansarimsa@hotmail.com","PM:15464923","","","",""

The results show that patients randomized to receive short-term ADT before and during radiation therapy (RT), rather than RT alone, had improved long-term disease-specific mortality, freedom from distant metastases, disease-free survival, freedom from biochemical failure, and possibly even overall survival. Importantly, no increase in the risk of fatal cardiac events was seen. The study did not, however, address the issue of the optimum duration of ADT; recent data suggest that longer courses of ADT (>=2 years), when added to RT, might further improve disease-free and even overall survival, especially in patients with high-grade disease","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This open-label, dose-escalation study by Attard et al. showed that abiraterone was well tolerated but often induced a syndrome of secondary mineralocorticoid excess that improved with eplerenone (a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist). Abiraterone is a potent suppressor of adrenal androgen synthesis, and produced lasting prostate-specific antigen responses in approximately half of the patients. A few patients had partial regression of distant metastases. Although promising, these results should be interpreted with caution owing to the small sample size and because the study was not primarily designed to examine drug efficacy. Multi-institutional, prospective trials should provide additional information on the tolerability and activity of this compound and further define the population most likely to benefit from this endocrine approach","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We selected a targeted therapy, sorafenib, because of its reported association with weight loss. PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients with metastatic renal cell cancer (RCC) who were resistant to standard therapy (N = 80) received sorafenib 400 mg twice daily or placebo in a randomized, double-blinded clinical trial. Computed tomography image analysis, which has high precision and specificity for evaluation of specific muscles and adipose tissues, was used to define change in total skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. Results At inclusion, 51% of patients were overweight or obese (ie, body mass index [BMI] > 25 kg/m(2)). Only 5% were underweight. Advanced muscle wasting (ie, sarcopenia) was present in 72% of patients with BMI less than 25 and in 34% of those with a BMI greater than 25. Patients received placebo for an average of 6 months and received sorafenib for 1 year. Patients in the placebo group had stable body weight during 6 months (0.8 kg +/- 0.7 kg), with no significant alteration of muscle or fat. Patients who received sorafenib lost 2.1 kg +/- 0.6 kg (P < .01) in 6 months and lost 4.2 kg +/- 0.7 kg (P < .01) by 1 year. Sorafenib-treated patients lost skeletal muscle progressively at 6 months (decrease of 4.9%; P < .01) and 12 months (decrease of 8.0%; P < .01). CONCLUSION Sarcopenia is prevalent in patients with metastatic RCC and is an occult condition in patients with normal or high BMI. Muscle loss is specifically exacerbated by sorafenib, consistent with the evidence for a role of kinases in regulating muscle mass. Muscle loss is a sorafenib adverse effect that may relate to asthenia, fatigue, and physical disability","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although these studies are encouraging, most focus on the rising population with prostate-specific antigen, and many involve small numbers of patients and do not adhere to consensus criteria for clinical trial designs in prostate cancer. Hence, although many promising agents are available for testing, such studies would benefit from closer collaboration between those in the fields of medical oncology and nuclear medicine","","","","","","jnumed.108.050658 [pii];10.2967/jnumed.108.050658 [doi]","Genitourinary Oncology Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA","PM:18997047","","","",""

Secondary endpoints included pharmacokinetics, toxicity analysis and overall survival. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study was an open-label, phase II, two-stage design, focusing on the results from the second stage, as criteria for progression were modified after completing the first stage. Sorafenib was given at a dose of 400 mg orally twice daily in 28-day cycles. Clinical and laboratory assessments were done every 4 weeks, and radiographic scans were obtained every 8 weeks. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients were accrued in the second stage; the median (range) age was 66 (49-85) years, the on-study prostate-specific antigen level was 68.45 (5.8-995) ng/mL, the Gleason score 8 (6-9) and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group status 1 (in 17 patients). Of the 24 patients, 21 had previous chemotherapy with docetaxel. All patients had bony metastases, either alone (in 11) or with soft-tissue disease (in 13). One patient had a partial response; 10 patients had stable disease (median duration 18 weeks, range 15-48). At a median potential follow-up of 27.2 months, the median progression-free survival was 3.7 months and the median overall survival was 18.0 months. For the whole trial of 46 patients the median survival was 18.3 months. Most frequent toxicities included hand-foot skin reaction (grade 2 in nine patients, grade 3 in three), rash, abnormalities in liver function tests, and fatigue. CONCLUSIONS: Sorafenib has moderate activity as a second-line treatment for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer","","","","","","BJU8327 [pii];10.1111/j.1464-410X.2008.08327.x [doi]","Medical Oncology Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA","PM:19154507","","","",""

METHODS: Patients with untreated stage C/D prostate cancer were randomized to MAB with bicalutamide plus a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist (LHRHa) or LHRHa monotherapy. QOL was evaluated at baseline and at weeks 1, 5, and 24 using the Japanese version of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P) questionnaire. RESULTS: A total of 203 patients were assessed for QOL. The MAB group had more rapid and greater improvements in 'emotional well-being' and 'prostate cancer-specific issues' domain scores than the monotherapy group. Further analysis of 'prostate cancer-specific issues' revealed that, compared with monotherapy, MAB provided a greater improvement in 'micturition disorder'-related QOL. Complete improvement rates for items related to 'pain and micturition disorder' were also higher with MAB. Item scores of 'pain and micturition disorder' did not correlate strongly with prostate-specific antigen levels or tumor size. Fewer patients who had deterioration in their 'pain and micturition disorder' item scores at week 1 in the MAB group than the monotherapy group. CONCLUSIONS: Maximum androgen blockade with bicalutamide plus LHRHa did not reduce the overall QOL of patients with previously untreated advanced prostate cancer.

Current practice entails the use of factors such as pretherapy grade, stage and PSA, PSA doubling time, nature of previous therapy and patient age and functional status for a treatment recommendation. For a PSA relapse post radical prostatectomy, radiation therapy to the prostatic fossa is a primary therapeutic consideration. With careful patient selection, about 30 to 40% of patients are rendered disease free using this approach. For patients with radiation therapy as the primary treatment for their prostate cancer, salvage prostatectomy can be considered, but is rarely feasible. Systemic therapy with hormones is standard if patients are not candidates for the above mentioned salvage local therapies or if they relapse after exhaustive local therapies. Unfortunately androgen suppressive therapy is unlikely to induce cure, or prolonged remissions in PSA relapse prostate cancer. The strategy of addition of chemotherapy or biologic therapy to androgen suppressive therapy is under active investigation. The goal of this therapy is to make an impact on the time to progression to metastatic prostate cancer and correspondingly decrease prostate cancer related mortality. Preliminary results of studies incorporating early chemotherapy in combination with androgen suppressive therapy are encouraging, with improvement in time to progression and overall survival. The evaluation of biologic agents and agents with better toxicity profiles is ongoing. This is very important to make therapy widely applicable and to enable prolonged administration especially in a disease such as prostate cancer with a relatively long natural history. Strategies of adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapy in locally advanced prostate cancer are exploring the possibility of reducing the chance of PSA relapse by treating micrometastatic disease. This review discusses the current practices in risk stratification and management of PSA relapse prostate cancer. It also highlights the major clinical trials and areas of active investigation in this field. (c) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It has therefore been prioritized as a candidate therapeutic target in patients with solid tumors. Several SRC inhibitors are now in development, of which dasatinib has been most explored. Preclinical studies in a wide variety of solid tumor cell lines, including prostate, breast and glioma, have shown that that dasatinib acts as a cytostatic agent, inhibiting the processes of cell proliferation, invasion and metastasis. Dasatinib also inhibits the activity of osteoclasts, which have a major role in the development of metastatic bone lesions. Dasatinib has additive or synergistic activity in combination with a number of other agents, including cytotoxic agents and targeted therapies, providing a rationale for combination treatment in a clinical setting. Emerging clinical data with dasatinib support experimental observations, with preliminary phase 1 and 2 data demonstrating activity, both as a single agent and as combination therapy, in a range of solid tumors. Future clinical trials will further assess the clinical value of SRC inhibition with dasatinib","","","","","","S0305-7372(10)00035-6 [pii];10.1016/j.ctrv.2010.02.015 [doi]","Genitourinary Center, M.D. Anderson Cancer Centre, Houston, TX 77030, USA. johna@mdanderson.org","PM:20226597","","","",""

This trial was designed to analyze toxicity, immunogenicity and time to treatment failure using vaccine, antiandrogen therapy or their sequential use. Materials and Methods: A total of 42 patients were randomized to receive vaccine vs antiandrogen therapy with nilutamide. The vaccine consisted of recombinant vaccinia viruses containing the PSA and B7.1 costimulatory genes as prime vaccinations, and avipox-PSA as boosters. After 6 months patients with an increasing PSA and no metastasis may receive a combination of both treatments. Results: Three patients on nilutamide were removed from study secondary to grade 3 toxicities but no grade 3 toxicities were attributed to vaccine. In the vaccine arm median time to treatment failure was 9.9 months with 13 of 21 decreases in PSA velocity vs 7.6 months with 16 of 21 decreases in PSA velocity in the nilutamide arm (p =0.28). Of the patients in the nilutamide arm 8 had vaccine added at the time of PSA progression. Median time to treatment failure with combined therapy was 5.2 months, with a median duration from study entry of 15.9 months. Of the patients in the vaccine arm 12 had nilutamide added at the time of PSA progression. Median time to treatment failure with combined therapy was 13.9 months and a median of 25.9 months from initiation of therapy. Conclusions: Further studies are merited to investigate the role of combining vaccine with antiandrogen therapy or vaccine followed by vaccine plus antiandrogen therapy in this patient population.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: TAX327 was a clinical trial that randomized 1,006 men with metastatic HRPC to receive every three week or weekly docetaxel or mitoxantrone, each with prednisone. We developed a multivariate Cox model and nomogram to predict survival at 1, 2, and 5 years. RESULTS: Ten independent prognostic factors other than treatment group were identified in multivariate analysis: (a) presence of liver metastases [hazard ratio (HR), 1.66; P = 0.019], (b) number of metastatic sites (HR, 1.63 if > or =2 sites; P = 0.001), (c) clinically significant pain (HR, 1.48; P < 0.0001), (d) Karnofsky performance status (HR, 1.39 if < or =70; P = 0.016), (e) type of progression (HR, 1.37 for measurable disease progression and 1.29 for bone scan progression; P = 0.005 and 0.01, respectively), (f) pretreatment prostate-specific antigen (PSA) doubling time (HR, 1.19 if <55 days; P = 0.066), (g) PSA (HR, 1.17 per log rise; P < 0.0001), (h) tumor grade (HR, 1.18 for high grade; P = 0.069), (i) alkaline phosphatase (HR, 1.27 per log rise; P < 0.0001), and (j) hemoglobin (HR, 1.11 per unit decline; P = 0.004). A nomogram was developed based on this multivariate model and validated internally using bootstrap methods, with a concordance index of 0.69. CONCLUSIONS: This multivariate model identified several new independent prognostic factors in men with metastatic HRPC, including PSA doubling time, and led to the successful development of a clinically applicable nomogram.

Here we examined various degrees of PSA decline and pain response as surrogates for the survival benefit observed in the TAX327 trial. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In the TAX327 trial, 1,006 men with HRPC were randomly assigned to receive docetaxel in two schedules, or mitoxantrone, each with prednisone: 989 men provided data on 3-month PSA decline. Surrogacy was examined for post-treatment changes in PSA and pain response using Cox proportional hazards models to calculate the proportion of treatment effect (PTE) explained by each potential surrogate. RESULTS: A > or = 30% PSA decline within 3 months of treatment initiation provides the highest degree of surrogacy, with a PTE of 0.66 (95% CI, 0.23 to 1.0), and was associated with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.50 (95% CI, 0.43 to 0.58) for overall survival after adjusting for treatment effect. Introduction of a > or = 30% PSA decline is predictive of survival regardless of treatment arm. Other changes in PSA or PSA kinetics, PSA normalization, and pain responses were highly prognostic but weaker surrogates for survival. CONCLUSION: In the TAX327 trial, a PSA decline of > or = 30% within 3 months of chemotherapy initiation had the highest degree of surrogacy for overall survival, confirming data from the Southwest Oncology Group 9916 trial. However, given the wide CIs around the estimate of this moderate surrogate effect, overall survival should remain the preferred end point for phase III trials of cytotoxic agents in HRPC","","","","","","25/25/3965 [pii];10.1200/JCO.2007.11.4769 [doi]","Duke Comprehensive Cancer Center, Durham, NC 27710, USA. andrew.armstrong@duke.edu","PM:17761981","","","",""

Satraplatin is being developed for the treatment of men with chemoreftactory BRPC for several reasons: 1) relative ease of administration, 2) potential lack of cross-resistance with other platinum agents, 3) clinical benefits seen in early studies of HRPC, and 4) an unmet need in this patient population after docetaxel failure. As men who have progressed after docetaxel and prednisone have an expected median survival of approxima tely 12 months, there is great opportunity for improved palliation in this disease. Satraplatin may provide a palliative benefit for these men in terms of progression-free survival according to the most recent analyses of the phase III SPARC trial comparing satraplatin and prednisone to prednisone alone in the second-line setting for HRPC, and is currently under USFDA review for this indication. Whether satraplatin and prednisone offer an advantage over docetaxel retreatment or other cytotoxic agents in this setting is an unanswered question and worthy of study. Investigation of predictors of platinum sensitivity and the use of satraplatin in patients with neuroendoc rine subsets of metastatic prostate cancer may be warranted given the advances in biomarker and genomic technology and the known sensitivity of small cell cancers to platinum agents. Further study of satraplatin alone or in combination with docetaxel or other molecular and chemotherapeutic agents seems warranted to improve on current outcomes. (c) 2007 Dove Medical Press Limited.

Although initially responsive to androgen ablation, many men eventually become castration resistant, develop skeletal metastases, and are palliatively treated with docetaxel-based chemotherapy, radiation therapy, bisphosphonates, and best supportive care. Given the modest success rates of the current standard of care, clinical trial enrollment is encouraged. Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is a heterogeneous disease, both in clinical manifestations and outcomes, requiring an individualized approach to both patient care and trial design. Herein, we review surrogate markers of disease progression and treatment efficacy in advanced prostate cancer in light of recently published guidelines that have redefined eligibility, response criteria, and suitable endpoints in prostate cancer drug development. The guidelines have refined outcome measures to potentially better capture clinical benefit and the ability of novel targeted molecular and biologic agents to impact favorably on this disease. We consider prostate-specific antigen changes, circulating tumor cells, bone scan alterations, markers of bone metabolism (urinary N-telopeptide and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase), pain improvements, and progression-free survival. To illustrate the role and challenges of these potential biomarkers and endpoints in drug development, we discuss a class of novel molecularly targeted agents, the src kinase inhibitors. Given that there are currently no validated surrogate markers of overall survival for assessing early clinical benefit from systemic therapy in metastatic CRPC, incorporation of relevant biomarkers into all phases of clinical development is essential to accelerate drug development in this field","","","","","","theoncologist.2009-0043 [pii];10.1634/theoncologist.2009-0043 [doi]","Department of Medicine and Surgery, Duke Comprehensive Cancer Center, Durham, NC 27710, USA. andrew.armstrong@duke.edu","PM:19684076","","","",""

We investigated pre-treatment factors that predicted a 30% PSA decline (30% PSAD) within 3 months of starting chemotherapy, and assessed performance of a risk group classification in predicting PSA declines and overall survival (OS) in men with mCRPC. METHODS: In TAX327, 1006 men with mCRPC were randomized to receive docetaxel (D) in two schedules, or mitoxantrone (M), each with prednisone: 989 provided data on PSA decline within 3 months. Predictive factors for a 30% PSAD were identified using multivariable regression in D-treated men (n=656) and validated in M-treated men (n=333). RESULTS: Four independent risk factors predicted 30% PSAD: pain, visceral metastases, anaemia and bone scan progression. Risk groups (good: 0-1 factors, intermediate: 2 factors and poor: 3-4 factors) were developed with median OS of 25.7, 18.7 and 12.8 months (p<0.0001); 30% PSAD in 78%, 66% and 58% of men (p<0.001); and measurable disease response in 19%, 9% and 5% of men (p=0.018), respectively. In the validation cohort, similar predictive ability was noted for 30% PSAD, tumour response and OS. PCWG2 subtypes were also predictive but resulted in unequal grouping. C-indices were 0.59 and 0.62 for 30% PSAD and OS in the validation dataset, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Risk groups have been identified and validated that predict PSAD and OS in men with mCRPC and may facilitate evaluation of new systemic regimens warranting definitive testing in comparison with docetaxel and prednisone. Prospective validation of this classification system is needed","","","","","","S0959-8049(09)00845-4 [pii];10.1016/j.ejca.2009.11.007 [doi]","Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, DUMC, Duke Comprehensive Cancer Center and the Duke Prostate Center, Durham, NC 27715, USA. andrew.armstrong@duke.edu","PM:20005697","","","",""

For many years the only available therapeutic modalities for patients with metastatic androgen independent prostate cancer have been second-line hormonal maneuvers with estrogens or steroids and chemotherapy. So far, chemotherapy has been shown to confer adequate palliation but no overall survival benefit in prospective randomized controlled trials, and the only chemotherapy drugs approved by the US Food and Drug Administration are mitoxantrone and estramustine. Novel treatment strategies that aim at specific signaling pathways, apoptosis, differentiation, or specific membranous targets are being developed.

These include second- and third-line hormone maneuvers, cytotoxic chemotherapy, systemic isotopes, bisphosphonates, biologically targeted agents, and palliative treatments such as external-beam radiotherapy. Optimal care requires clarity of purpose and experienced judgment of potential benefits and risks. The field has grown rapidly, and there is recent evidence of significant benefit from chemotherapy, in terms of both prolongation of life and symptom relief, using a regimen well tolerated in relatively elderly and infirm patients. The combination of docetaxel with prednisone has a clear role in patients with symptomatic hormone-refractory prostate cancer; however, a number of controversies exist, for example, the dose, cycle interval, duration of treatment, whether to combine docetaxel with other cytotoxic or biologically targeted agents, and its role in patients with asymptomatic disease. The overall benefit of bisphosphonate therapy is less clear in prostate cancer than in other malignancies. As our understanding of t he biochemical basis of relative androgen-independence grows, development of targeted agents will become more appropriate and efficient. This is an active field of research and currently there are trials addressing both new cytotoxic agents, such as satraplatin and the epothilones, and a range of biological targets, including the vitamin D receptor, the endothelin A receptor, an augmented prostatic acid phosphatase antigen, as well as tumor angiogenesis.

These guidelines have been continuously updated since many important changes affecting the clinical management of patients with prostate cancer have occurred over the past years. The aim of this paper is to present a summary of the 2005 update of the EAU guidelines on prostate cancer. Methods: A literature review of the new data has been performed by the working panel. The guidelines have been updated and level of evidence/grade of recommendation added to the text. This enables readers to better understand the quality of the data forming the basis of the recommendations. Results: A full version is available at the EAU Office or at www.uroweb.org. Systemic prostate biopsies under ultrasound guidance is the preferred diagnostic method and the use of periprostatic injection of a local anaesthetic can significantly reduce pain/discomfort associated with the procedure. Active treatment (surgery or radiation) is mostly recommended for patients with localized disease and a long life expectancy with radical prostatectomy being the only treatment evaluated in a ran domized controlled trial. Follow-up is at large based on prostate specific antigen (PSA) and a disease-specific history with imaging only indicated when symptoms occur. Cytotoxic therapy has become an option for selected patients with hormone refractory prostate cancer. Conclusion: The knowledge in the field of prostate cancer is rapidly changing. These EAU guidelines on prostate cancer summarize the most recent findings and put them into clinical practice. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Chemotherapy has demonstrated a benefit over steroids in improving the quality of life in the hormone refractory phase. Furthermore, the introduction of docetaxel succeeded in improving the survival of these patients in first-line therapy. Second-line treatment following docetaxel is challenging with no agent classified as standard in this setting. In the last 5 years, several drugs have shown promising results in initial evaluation. However, randomized phase III trials would be needed to answer this question. The majority of patients develop bone metastasis and the use of bisphosphonates has yielded encouraging results. Our understanding of the biology of hormone refractory prostate cancer has improved dramatically over the past few years and has translated into the developments of new therapeutic targets for this disease. Agents affecting several targets, including calcitriol, endotheline-1, bcl-2, and angiogenesis, are being studied currently and have the potential to change the treatment paradigms of this otherwise fatal disease. This review focuses on current and potential treatment options, including cytotoxic agents, bisphosphonates, and targeted agents, for patients with hormone refractory prostate cancer and the impact of these options on survival and quality of life","","","","","","10.1097/CAD.0b013e3282ff0f48 [doi];00001813-200807000-00012 [pii]","Department of Medical Oncology, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Egypt. hatemazim@cairocure.com","PM:18525325","","","",""

The aim of this study was to compare the analgesic effect of radionuclide therapy using Sr and Sm-EDTMP in patients with painful bone metastases of these tumours. MATERIAL AND METHODS: One hundred patients treated with radionuclide bone palliation therapy were analysed. The study population consisted of 60 male patients with advanced prostate carcinoma and 40 female patients with advanced breast carcinoma. Fifty patients (30 men and 20 women) were treated with Sr (150 MBq). The other 50 patients were treated with Sm-EDTMP (37 MBq x kg). The treatment efficacy was evaluated by a visual analogue scale (VAS), Karnofsky performance scale, and dosage of analgesic drugs used. RESULTS: Complete pain relief was found in 40% of women and 40% of men treated using Sm-EDTMP and in 25% of women and 33% of men treated with Sr. No analgesic effect occurred in 20% of patients. A better analgesic effect was found in cases of osteoblastic metastases compared to mixed metastases. Statistically significant reduction of pain intensity, use of analgesic drugs and improvement of performance in Karnofsky scale was found in cases of both radionuclides. CONCLUSIONS: The analgesic effects of Sr and Sm-EDTMP was similar in both prostate and breast carcinoma. However, the effect was dependent on the type of metastases; better response was observed in cases of osteoblastic metastases than in patients with mixed metastases.

Clinical confirmation of tumor spread to these organs is a negative prognostic sign that marks the stage when disease is rarely curable. Today, treatment of bone metastases is primarily palliative. The aims of treatment are to relieve pain, prevent development of pathologic fractures, improve mobility and function, and if possible, prolong survival. Significant improvements in our understanding of tumor biology along with early tumor detection has led to the discovery of few innovative approaches aimed to treat bone metastases. The most promising treatment modalities include combination of anti-cancer therapies (surgery, radiation therapy, citostatic therapy) with bone antiresorptive therapies (bisphosphonate) that specifically target osteoclasts, bone resorbing cells. The osteoclast, whose increased activity is induced by the tumor, is responsible for the deterioration of bone mass and structure along with the release of grow factors that feed back and support further tumor growth. The current pharmaceutical approach is to target bone metastases by developing drugs that specifically target tumor cells in bone in addition to bone stroma since skeletal metastases are more resistant to treatment, present the highest bulk of tumor mass in the body, serve as site for secondary spread of tumor cells, and are associated with significant morbidity. There is a real need for a more effective modified release of newer anti-cancer drugs such as gene therapy and immunotherapy by using established and novel delivery platforms that will improve therapy and reduce side effects as a result of more appropriate plasma profiles. Overall, however, developments regarding treatment of cancer metastases to bone are encouraging. The scope of future advancements is immense and includes innovative therapeutics and delivery systems aimed to improve skeletal affinity, selectivity, and efficacy of drugs","","","","","","S0169-409X(05)00078-5 [pii];10.1016/j.addr.2004.12.014 [doi]","Pfizer Inc, Global Research and Development, Safety Sciences Groton, Eastern Point Road 8274-1312, Groton, CT 06340, USA. cedo_bagi@groton.pfizer.com","PM:15876400","","","",""

A total of 268 bone tumours were studied and the average incidence was 27 tumours a year, or two per one million inhabitants. Of these tumours 48% were benign, 45% were primary bone cancers and only 6% were metastatic disease. Among the primary malignant bone tumours, osteosarcoma was the most frequent (39%), followed by non-Hodgkin's primary bone lymphoma, fibrosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, and Ewing's sarcoma. Primary site of the metastatic bone tumours was prostatic adenocarcinoma, breast cancer, hepatocarcinoma and thyroid cancer. In Cameroon many bone tumours are not diagnosed due to lack of medical facilities and little awareness among our medical staff. It is likely that the real incidence is at least ten times higher than that shown in our report","","","","","","10.1007/s00264-003-0480-7 [doi]","Service d'Orthopedie et de Traumatologie, Hopitaux Universitaires de Yaounde, Yaounde, Camaroon. jbahebeck@yahoo.fr","PM:12942193","","","",""

Rectal and urinary toxicities are the principal limiting factors in delivering a high target dose to patients affected by prostate cancer. The verification of such toxicity is an important step before starting a dose-escalation program. The present observational study reports on the acute and late rectal and urinary toxicky in relation with dose-volume parameters in 104 patients with localized prostate cancer treated with 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy. Methods and study design. One hundred and four patients with stage Tlb-T3b prostate cancer were treated with t hree-dimensional conformal radiation therapy to a total dose of 74 Gy, 2 Gy per fraction. Rigid dose constraints were applied for rectum and bladder. Acute and late rectal and urinary toxicities were analyzed also in relation to dose-volume histograms. Biochemical relapse-free survival was defined according to the American Society of Therapeutic Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) criteria and to the RTOG-ASTRO Phoenix Consensus Conference Recommendations using the Kaplan-Meier method. Results. No grade 3 toxicity was observed. Acute and late grade 2 toxicity rates were 5.8% and 9.0% for rectum and 12.5% and 2.0% for bladder, respectively. Rectal V70 influenced the occurrence of late grade 2 toxicity. A relationship between acute and late urinary to xicity was also found. After a median follow-up of 30 months (range, 20-50), the actuarial overall and biochemical relapse-free survival rates were 84% and 77%, respectively, with a significant difference between low-intermediate and high-risk patients. Conclusions. Conformal radiotherapy to the dose of 74 Gy was administered with good compliance. The incidence of acute and late toxicity was relatively low in accord with our dose constraints. Rectal V70 proved to be a reliable prognosticator of late toxicity. Overall survival and biochemical relapse-free survival rates were more favorable for low and intermediate-risk and significantly less favorable for high-risk patients","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We studied the incidence, characteristics, and risk factors for the development of ONJ among patients treated with bisphosphonates for bone metastases. PATIENTS AND METHODS: ONJ was assessed prospectively since July 2003. The first bisphosphonate treatment among patients with ONJ was administered in 1997. Two hundred fifty-two patients who received bisphosphonates since January 1997 were included in this analysis. RESULTS: Seventeen patients (6.7%) developed ONJ: 11 of 111 (9.9%) with multiple myeloma, two of 70 (2.9%) with breast cancer, three of 46 (6.5%) with prostate cancer, and one of 25 (4%) with other neoplasms (P = .289). The median number of treatment cycles and time of exposure to bisphosphonates were 35 infusions and 39.3 months for patients with ONJ compared with 15 infusions (P < .001) and 19 months (P = .001), respectively, for patients with no ONJ. The incidence of ONJ increased with time to exposure from 1.5% among patients treated for 4 to 12 months to 7.7% for treatment of 37 to 48 months. The cumulative hazard was significantly higher with zoledronic acid compared with pamidronate alone or pamidronate and zoledronic acid sequentially (P < .001). All but two patients with ONJ had a history of dental procedures within the last year or use of dentures. CONCLUSION: The use of bisphosphonates seems to be associated with the development of ONJ. Length of exposure seems to be the most important risk factor for this complication. The type of bisphosphonate may play a role and previous dental procedures may be a precipitating factor","","","","","","23/34/8580 [pii];10.1200/JCO.2005.02.8670 [doi]","Department of Clinical Therapeutics, Medical School, University of Athens, Greece","PM:16314620","","","",""

Agents, such as antibodies, can target molecules that are relatively unique to cancer cells. Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is the most well-established, highly restricted prostate-cancer-related cell membrane antigen known. Ten years ago, the FDA approved SUP 111In-capromab pendetide for use in imaging soft-tissue, but not bone, sites of metastatic prostate cancer for presurgical staging or the evaluation of PSA relapse after local ther apy. For presurgical patients with high-risk disease but negative bone, CT and MRI scans, capromab demonstrated the ability to identify some patients with positive nodes, thereby sparing them an unnecessary surgical procedure. But there have been no follow-up studies to indicate that high-risk patients with a negative capromab scan have a lower failure rate after surgery. In the setting of PSA relapse, capromab is compromised by its inability to sensitively image bone metastases; bone is the first site of metastatic prostate cancer in 72% of patients. The problem with imaging bone metastases is that capromab detects an antigenic site on the intracellular portion of P SMA - a site not accessible to circulating antibodies. Early results indicate that second-generation antibodies that target the extracellular domain of PSMA might provide significant benefits in the imaging of prostate cancer.

Tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 11b (TNFRSF11B) is a critical regulator between PCa cells and the bone environment. Recently, TNFRSF11B rs10505346 has been implicated in PCa risk in the Cancer Genetic Markers of Susceptibility genomewide association study. However, the association between this variant and biochemical failure in PCa patients receiving radical prostatectomy (RP) has not been determined. METHODS: Associations of TNFRSF11B rs10505346 with age at diagnosis, preoperative prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, Gleason score, pathologic stage, surgical margin, and PSA recurrence were evaluated in a cohort of 314 localized PCa patients receiving RP. The prognostic significance on PSA recurrence was assessed by Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox regression model. RESULTS: The mean level of preoperative PSA and the relative risks of PSA recurrence after RP were lower in individuals with T allele than in those with the G allele at TNFRSF11B rs10505346 (P = 0.019 and 0.014, respectively). The T allele of rs10505346 remained a protective factor against PSA recurrence (P = 0.022) in multivariate Cox regression model after considering all clinicopathological risk factors except PSA level. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that TNFRSF11B rs10505346 is associated with PSA level and might be a prognostic factor for the recurrence of PSA in PCa patients receiving RP","","","","","","10.1245/s10434-010-0994-3 [doi]","Department of Pharmacy, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan","PM:20204532","","","",""

Because in vitro studies suggest that low levels of electromagnetic fields may modify cancer cell growth, we hypothesized that systemic delivery of a combination of tumor-specific frequencies may have a therapeutic effect. We undertook this study to identify tumor-specific frequencies and test the feasibility of administering such frequencies to patients with advanced cancer. Patients and methods. We examined patients with various types of cancer using a noninvasive biofeedback method to identify tumor-specific frequencies. We offered compassionate treatment to some patients with advanced cancer and limited therapeutic options. Results. We examined a total o f 163 patients with a diagnosis of cancer and identified a total of 1524 frequencies ranging from 0.1 Hz to 114 kHz. Most frequencies (57-92%) were specific for a single tumor type. Compassionate treatment with tumor-specific frequencies was offered to 28 patients. Three patients experienced grade 1 fatigue during or immediately after treatment. There were no NCI grade 2, 3 or 4 toxicities. Thirteen patients were evaluable for response. One patient with hormone-refractory breast cancer metastatic to the adrenal gland and bones had a complete response lasting 11 months. One patient with hormone-refractory breast cancer metastatic to liver and bones had a partial response lasting 13.5 months. Four patients had stable disease lasting for +34.1 months (thyroid cancer metastatic to lung), 5.1 months (non-small cell lung cancer), 4.1 months (pancreatic cancer metastatic to liver) and 4.0 months (leiomyosarcoma metastatic to liver). Conclusion. Cancer-related frequencies appear to be tumor-specific and treatment with tumor-specific frequencies is feasible, well tolerated and may have biological efficacy in patients with advanced cancer.

METHODS: Seventy-one men with biochemical recurrence after primary therapy for prostate cancer were prospectively enrolled from 1996 to 1998. Forty-two patients had undergone radical retropubic prostatectomy and 29 had undergone external beam radiotherapy. Radionuclide bone scans and computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis showed no metastasis. The initial treatment with finasteride (5 mg twice daily) and flutamide (125 mg twice daily) was continued unless participants were unable to tolerate the agents or experienced PSA progression. RESULTS: At a mean of 44.4 months (range 12 to 92) of follow-up, 54 (76%) of 71 patients were available for measurement of disease status and response to therapy. Three patients had died of unrelated causes; 5 men withdrew from the study because of side effects and 1 patient for protocol violation. Eight patients were lost to follow-up. Twenty-seven patients (38%) continued receiving therapy with no evidence of PSA progression (PSA level less than 0.4 ng/mL), 6 patients maintained a more than 50% reduction in their baseline PSA level at the time of analysis, and 21 (29%) had PSA progression (ie, elevated PSA level on three consecutive tests more than 4 weeks apart). Major side effects were breast tenderness (90%), gynecomastia (72%), gastrointestinal disturbances (22%), fatigue (10%), and decreased libido (4%). The side effects were mild and well tolerated by most patients. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of finasteride and flutamide showed a moderate efficacy in patients with PSA-only recurrence after definitive therapy. The efficacy appears to be greater in patients who can achieve a PSA nadir of 0.1 ng/mL or less after the start of treatment","","","","","","S0090429503006678 [pii]","Division of Urology, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver, Colorado 80262, USA","PM:14624911","","","",""

Toxicities, the need for transfusions and survival were also analysed. Materials and methods: In our retrospective review, 103 men aged 50-87 years, with skeletal metastases from prostate cancer, received modified hemi-body irradiation (HBI) during a consecutive 10-year period, using the same radiotherapy technique and dose. The upper HBI field excluded the region above the ramus of the mandible and the lower HBI field excluded the lower limb below the knee. A successful outcome was determined by assessing the pain response in combination with a change in analgesic intake. Results: Twenty patients received upper HBI; 17/20 (85%) had a successful outcome at the 6-week review, sustained in 94.1% at the final follow-up with no need for radiotherapy to the skull. Thirty-eight patients received lower HBI; 26/38 (68.4%) had a successful outcome at the 6-week review, sustained in 80.8% at the final follow-up with no need for radiotherapy to the lower leg. Forty-five patients received sequential HBI; 33/45 (73.3%) had a successful outcome at the 6-week review, sustained in 87.9% at the final follow-up, with three patients requiring further radiotherapy to the skull (2/45) or lower leg (1/45). Only 5/103 patients (4.8%) developed new skeletal events in the treated area. Toxicity and transfusion requirements were minimal. Conclusions: Modifying the field size for single-fraction HBI does not have a significant effect on the final outcome of treatment, namely pain control and a need for additional radiotherapy. In our experience, modified HBI should be considered in patients with multiple bone pain sites, especially if they will probably require several visits for localised radiotherapy to single painful bone sites within a short period of time.

SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register (March 2007), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2007, MEDLINE (from 2003 to March 2007), EMBASE (from 2005 to March 2007), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (February 2007). References from trials and reviews were also searched. Pharmaceutical companies were contacted for unpublished trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials of adults and children at high risk of developing NMSC. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently selected studies and assessed their methodological quality. MAIN RESULTS: We identified 10 trials (7,229 participants) that assessed a variety of interventions.One trial found T4N5 liposome lotion significantly reduced the rate of appearance of new BCCs in people with xeroderma pigmentosum.One of three trials of renal transplant recipients showed a significantly reduced risk of new NMSCs when acitretin was compared to placebo (relative risk (RR) 0.22 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.06 to 0.90) and no significant difference in risk of adverse events in two trials (RR 1.80, 95% CI 0.70 to 4.61).In three trials conducted in people with a history of NMSC, the evidence was inconclusive for the development of BCCs for retinol or isoretinoin. However the risk of a new SCC in one trial (HR 1.79, 95% CI 1.16 to 2.76) and adverse events in another trial (RR 1.76, 95% CI 1.57 to 1.97) were significantly increased in the isotretinoin group compared with placebo.In one trial selenium showed a reduced risk of other types of cancer compared with placebo (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.85) but also a significantly elevated risk of a new NMSC (HR 1.17, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.34). The evidence for one trial of beta-carotene was inconclusive; and there was a trend towards fewer new NMSC in a trial of a reduced fat diet (RR 0.16, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.31), p = 0.09. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Some preventative treatments may benefit people at high risk of developing NMSC, but the ability to draw firm conclusions is limited by small numbers of trials, often with one trial per intervention or with inconsistent results between studies. INTERVENTIONS FOR PREVENTING OF NON-MELANOMA SKIN CANCERS IN HIGH-RISK GROUPS: Non-melanoma skin cancer is still the most common cancer in the UK, the United States and Australia. People at increased risk of getting non-melanoma skin cancer include those with lowered immunity, a history of non-melanoma skin cancer, rare inherited genetic skin disorders, trauma to the skin, exposure to arsenic, albinism or having had psoralen and ultraviolet A treatment. Very few studies have been conducted in people at increased risk of NMSC.For people with Xeroderma pigmentosum (a rare inherited genetic skin disorder) topical application of T4N5 liposome lotion is beneficial in reducing the rate of appearance of new basal cell carcinomas, however it may increase the risk of a new squamous cell carcinoma. Acitretin in renal transplant recipients may be of some benefit, however, high doses of acitretin are associated with an increased number of adverse events. Retinol or a reduced fat diet may be worth trying for people with a history of non-melanoma skin cancer. Further prevention studies for people at increased risk of non-melanoma skin cancer are needed","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The outcomes of interest are pain response, analgesic consumption, overall survival, adverse effects and quality of life. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic review of the English published literature was undertaken to provide evidence relevant to the above outcomes. RESULTS: Six randomized phase III trials, two randomized phase II trials and one randomized crossover trial of strontium-89 were reviewed. A randomized phase III trial comparing strontium-89 plus cisplatin with strontium-89 plus placebo reported a significantly higher proportion of patients experiencing pain relief for a significantly longer duration with strontium-89 plus cisplatin. A randomized phase III trial comparing adjuvant strontium-89 with placebo following radiotherapy reported a higher proportion of pain-free patients with strontium-89. Patients who received strontium-89 also experienced fewer new sites of bone pain. A second, but underpowered study failed to confirm these results. In one randomized trial of strontium-89 versus radiotherapy (hemibody or local), patients treated with strontium-89 developed fewer new sites of pain. In a second trial comparing strontium-89 versus local radiotherapy, median overall survival was improved with radiotherapy, while pain response and time-to-progression were similar in the two groups. One randomized phase III trial reported no difference in pain relief between strontium-89 and placebo. Three randomized phase III trials and two randomized phase II trials investigating samarium-153 were reviewed. In a randomized phase III trial of three different doses of samarium-153, the pain responses were similar for all three doses. In a randomized phase III trial of two different doses of samarium-153 versus placebo, the complete pain response rate was significantly higher with the higher dose of samarium-153 compared with placebo. In a randomized phase III trial comparing samarium-153 with placebo, significant differences favouring samarium-153 were reported for pain and opiate use. In addition, one randomized phase III trial, two randomized phase II trials, one randomized crossover trial and 13 phase II or phase I trials of rhenium, one phase I trial of tin-117 m and one phase II trial of phosphorus-32 were reviewed. The majority of patients treated in trials of radiopharmaceuticals where histology was specified had metastatic breast cancer (approximately 5-10% of patients reported), metastatic hormone-refractory prostate cancer (80-90% of patients reported) or metastatic lung cancer (5-10% of patients reported). Information on histologic subtype was not available for a significant proportion of patients treated on trials (30-40% of patients reported). CONCLUSIONS: Use of single-agent radiopharmaceuticals (strontium-89 and samarium-153) should be considered as a possible option for the palliation of multiple sites of bone pain from metastatic cancer where pain control with conventional analgesic regimens is unsatisfactory and where activity on a bone scan of the painful lesions is demonstrated. Ongoing clinical research should seek to establish the benefit of newer radiopharmaceuticals and radiopharmaceuticals in combination with other systemic therapies","","","","","","","London Regional Cancer Centre, Ont., Canada","PM:16299924","","","",""

METHODS: Thirty-eight men (mean age, 69+/-8 years) with biopsy-proven prostate cancer underwent both imaging modalities within a maximum interval of 2 weeks. Seventeen patients were evaluated preoperatively, and 21 patients were referred for post-operative evaluation of suspected recurrence or progression based on clinical algorithms. The number, sites and morphological patterns of bone lesions on (18)F FCH and (18)F fluoride PET-CT were correlated: Concordant lesions between the two modalities with corresponding changes on CT were considered to be positive for malignancy; discordant lesions were verified by follow-up examinations. The mean follow-up interval was 9.1 months. RESULTS: Overall, 321 lesions were evaluated in this study. In a lesion-based analysis, a relatively close agreement was found between these two imaging modalities for detection of malignant bone lesions (kappa=0.57), as well as in a patient-based analysis (kappa=0.76). Sixteen malignant sclerotic lesions with a high density were negative in both (18)F FCH and (18)F fluoride PET-CT [mean Hounsfield unit (HU), 1,148+/-364]. There was also a significant correlation between tracer intensity by SUV and density of sclerotic lesions by HU both in (18)F FCH PET-CT (r= -0.28, p < 0.006) and (18)F fluoride PET-CT (r= -0.20, p<0.05). The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of PET-CT in the detection of bone metastases in prostate cancer was 81%, 93% and 86% for (18)F fluoride, and 74% (p=0.12), 99% (p=0.01) and 85% for FCH, respectively. (18)F FCH PET-CT led to a change in the management in two out of 38 patients due to the early detection of bone marrow metastases. (18)F fluoride PET-CT identified more lesions in some patients when compared with (18)F FCH PET-CT but did not change patient management. CONCLUSION: FCH PET-CT may be superior for the early detection (i.e. bone marrow involvement) of metastatic bone disease. In patients with FCH-negative suspicious sclerotic lesions, a second bone-seeking agent (e.g. (18)F fluoride) is recommended. (18)F fluoride PET-CT demonstrated a higher sensitivity than (18)F FCH PET-CT, but the difference was not statistically significant. Furthermore, (18)F fluoride PET could be also negative in highly dense sclerotic lesions, which presumably reflects the effect of treatment. It will be important to clarify in future studies whether these lesions are clinically relevant when compared with metabolically active bone metastases","","","","","","10.1007/s00259-008-0788-z [doi]","PET-CT Center LINZ, St. Vincent's Hospital-Nuclear Medicine and Endocrinology, Seilerstaette 4, Linz, Uperaustria 4010, Austria. mohsen.beheshti@bhs.at","PM:18465129","","","",""

Detection of metastatic bone disease is particularly important in prostate cancer patients with high probability for distant metastases before embarking on radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy. The choice of imaging modalities that best depict the metastatic bony lesions may vary depending on different patterns of bone metastases. Bone scintigraphy has been used routinely in the evaluation of prostate cancer patients in the last decades. However, it suffers from adequate specificity. Single photon emission tomography (SPECT) increases the sensitivity and specificity of planar bone scanning especially for the evaluation of the spine. Recently, positron emission tomography (PET) using F-18 Fluoride shows promising results in the detection of bone metastases especially in cancers with prominent osteoblasic pattern of bone metastases such as prostate cancer. This article reviews the value of conventional planar bone scanning, SPECT, SPECT/CT as well as F-18 Fluoride PET/CT in the assessment of bone metastases in prostate cancer patients.

In this study, we have evaluated the potential role of FCH-PET/CT for the assessment of bone metastases in patients with prostate cancer. Furthermore, we assessed the pattern of metabolic uptake by FCH in relation to morphologic changes on CT. Methods: Seventy men with biopsy-proven prostate cancer underwent FCH-PET/CT for preoperative staging or follow-up evaluation. Thirty-two patients were evaluated preoperatively, and 38 patients wer e referred for postoperative evaluation of suspected recurrence or progression based on clinical algorithms. PET imaging consisted of a dynamic PET/CT acquisition of the pelvic region during 8 min (1 min frames) starting 1 min after i.v. injection of 4.07 MBq/kg/bw FCH, which was followed immediately by a semi-whole body acquisition. Results: Overall, 262 lesions showed increased uptake on FCH-PET. Two hundred ten lesions (210 of 262) were interpreted as bone metastases. The mean of maximum standardized uptake value (SUV SUB max ) in all malignant lesions was 8.1+/-3.9. Forty-nine lesions (24%) had no detectable morphological changes on CT-probably due to bone marrow metastases. Fifty-six sclerotic lesions (having a Hounsfield unit (HU) level of more than 825) were interpreted as highly suspicious for metastatic bone disease on CT and/or other imaging modalities such as the bone scan, but showed no FCH uptake. There was a significant correlation between tracer uptake as assessed by SUV and the density of sclerotic lesions by HU (r=-0.52, p<0.001). The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of FCH-PET/CT in detecting bone metastases from prostate cancer was 79%, 97%, and 84%, respectively. Conclusion: FCH-PET/CT showed promising results for the early detection of bone metastases in prostate cancer patients. We have found that a HU level of above 825 is associated with an absence of FCH uptake. Almost all of the FCH-negative sclerotic lesions were detected in patients who we re under hormone therapy, which raises the possibility that these lesions might no longer be viable. However, clarification and the prognostic value of such lesions require further research. (c) 2009 Academy of Molecular Imaging","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The importance of prognostic models lies in their ability to capture clinically relevant and measurable variables for routine use by clinicians to inform patients, and improve palliation and treatment decisions. Basically this allows for the creation of homogeneous prognostic strata for randomised comparative trials of therapeutic agents. In the last few years different models to predict patient outcome in HRPC have been published in the literature. Recently, based on the phase III randomised trial of docetaxel, a multivariate prognostic model incorporating PSA kinetics has been developed to predict survival at 1, 2 and 5 years in metastatic HRPC men treated with chemotherapy. This novel model includes new independent clinical prognostic factors in addition to PSA-DT such as baseline pain, type of progression at baseline (measurable disease or bone scan compared with PSA only), presence of liver metastases and the number of metastatic disease sites. This nomogram will be a helpful tool to stratify patients for further docetaxel-based trials and could also help us to delineate the potential benefits of chemotherapy at certain points during the natural history of HRPC","","","","","","1197 [pii]","Department of Medical Oncology, University Hospital del Mar-IMIM, Barcelona, Spain. jbellmunt@imas.imim.es","PM:19211372","","","",""

Up to 40% of men diagnosed with PCa will eventually develop metastatic disease, and although most respond to initial medical or surgical castration, progression to castration resistance is universal. The average survival for patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is 2-3 yr. OBJECTIVE: To discuss the biologic rationale and evidence supporting current management of patients with CRPC and to review promising novel agents. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Electronic databases (PubMed, ClinicalTrials.gov), relevant journals, and conference proceedings were searched manually for preclinical studies, clinical trials, and biomarker analyses focused on the treatment of CRPC. Keywords included castrate resistant prostate cancer and: targeted therapy, novel therapy, immunotherapy, androgen therapy, bone therapy, mechanisms, biomarkers, and trial endpoints; no time range was specified. Information pertaining to current studies was discussed with key opinion leaders. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: We focus on the efficacy and safety of approved agents, promising therapies that have proceeded to phase 3 evaluation, and those that have enhanced our understanding of the biology of CRPC. Biomarkers are considered in the context of novel targeted agents and immunotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: CRPC has many targets. Four new agents with different mechanisms of action have recently been shown to have positive results in large phase 3 randomized trials, and have already been approved in the United States for CRPC: cabazitaxel, sipuleucel-T, denosumab, and abiraterone acetate. With our improved understanding of tumor biology and the incorporation of new prognostic and molecular biomarkers into clinical trials, we are making progress in the management of patients with CRPC","","","","","","S0302-2838(11)00477-5 [pii];10.1016/j.eururo.2011.04.038 [doi]","Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA","PM:21592649","","","",""

Malignancies that can cause destruction of skeletal bones include multiple myeloma and metastatic diseases of the lung, prostate and other solid cancers. The clinical complications include pain, fractures, compression of the spinal cord and hypercalcemia of malignancy. Bisphosphonates are bone-seeking agents originally designed to treat loss of bone density. Accumulating data show that they are effective in diseases in which there is upregulation of osteoclastic or osteolytic activity. Bisphosphonates can reduce skeletal-related events and bone pain, as well as reduce the adverse effects of androgen deprivation therapy on skeletal integrity. However, it is clear that bisphosphonates do not represent a decisive treatment in the care of metastases but a therapeutic choice in synergy with regular anti-tumor drugs. The preclinical and clinical data to support this are reviewed here. Copyright (c) by BIOLIFE, s.a.s","","","","","","","","","","","",""

On the basis of results from three large, randomized, phase III clinical trials enrolling more than 3,000 patients, zoledronic acid (4 mg via 15-minute infusion) was approved in the United States for the treatment of patients with documented bone metastases from solid tumors in conjunction with standard antineoplastic therapy and patients with multiple myeloma. Zoledronic acid is also approved in Europe for the prevention of skeletal-related events in patients with advanced malignancies involving bone. Current treatment guidelines published by the American Society of Clinical Oncology recommend the use of intravenous bisphosphonates at first radiographic evidence of osteopenia in patients with multiple myeloma or osteolytic bone lesions in patients with breast cancer to significantly reduce the occurrence and delay the onset of skeletal complications. Zoledronic acid has also demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of bone metastases in patients with prostate cancer, lung cancer, and other solid tumors. Bisphosphonate therapy is generally well tolerated but can be associated with increases in serum creatinine. Therefore, monitoring renal function is required for all patients receiving bisphosphonate therapy. Serum creatinine should be monitored before each dose and treatment withheld until any serum creatinine elevations have resolved to baseline levels. Caution should be exercised when treating patients who are receiving other potentially nephrotoxic therapies. With these simple precautions, intravenous bisphosphonate therapy is safe for long-term use and provides durable treatment benefits","","","","","","10/1/52 [pii];10.1634/theoncologist.10-1-52 [doi]","Monteray Zoledronic Acidf Advisory Board, Institute for Myeloma & Bone Cancer Research, 9201 W.

The secondary aim was to evaluate side effects of the treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 44 patients received lower (n = 37), upper (n = 5), or sequential HBI (n = 2). The dose for lower HBI was 8 Gy in one fraction and for upper HBI 7 Gy in one fraction, with reduction of the lung dose to 6 Gy in one fraction by partial shielding. The majority of patients (n = 41) were males with prostate cancers (93%). Outcome and side effects were measured by the EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire C30 (QLQ-C30), and by the doctors' toxicity scores in the medical record. Pain relief was defined as a reduction of more than 10 points on the QLQ-C30 scale. Evaluations were performed before and 2, 4, 8, 16, and 24 weeks after treatment. RESULTS: Relief of pain was observed in 76% of the patients receiving HBI with 8.8% of the patients experiencing complete pain relief with no residual pain in the treated field. For most patients, the pain relief was lasting throughout the follow-up period. About one third of the patients were able to reduce their intake of analgesics. Grade 1-2 diarrhoea was the most common side effect observed in 49% of the patients two weeks after treatment. Mild pulmonary symptoms (grade 1-2) were observed in four of seven patients receiving upper HBI. No clear effect was observed on the patients' global quality of life. CONCLUSION: Single fraction HBI is safe and effective providing long lasting pain reduction in 76% of patients with multiple bone metastases","","","","","","905017630 [pii];10.1080/02841860802488128 [doi]","Department of Oncology, Aalborg Hospital, Aarhus University, Denmark","PM:18979285","","","",""

This observation provides the rationale for the use of bisphosphonates for managing bone metastatic prostate cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed the literature on the mechanisms by which prostate cancer affects bone cell function and disrupts physiological bone turnover. We also summarized the clinical results of bisphosphonate for treating bone pain in patients with prostate cancer. RESULTS: Metastatic prostate cancer in bone interferes with physiological bone remodeling by abnormal release of the hormones and paracrine factors physiologically involved in the modulation of osteoblastic and osteoclastic activity. Tumor induced bone formation and resorption develop within the same metastasis but excessive new bone is deposited away from bone resorption sites and does not contribute to bone strength. The increase in bone resorption may also be a generalized phenomenon that is most likely due to iatrogenic osteoporosis or related to hyperparathyroidism in response to the increased calcium demand. The bone resorption index in patients with bone metastatic prostate cancer correlates with bone pain and is an independent predictor of adverse skeletal events. However, small clinical studies of the efficacy of bisphosphonates for controlling bone pain in patients with prostate cancer show contradictory results. CONCLUSIONS: Improved understanding of the pathophysiology of prostate cancer induced metabolic bone disease implies that bisphosphonates may have a role in the treatment of this disorder. This issue is being addressed by large-scale ongoing randomized studies","","","","","","S0022-5347(05)65498-5 [pii]","Department of Clinical Science and Biology, Universita degli Studi di Torino, Torino, Italy","PM:11696699","","","",""

Androgen suppression by either orchiectomy or administration of luteinising hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) analogues is the mainstay of treatment. Since the use of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) serum testing has become widespread, however, the timing of endocrine therapy has expanded considerably to include patients with limited involvement of extraprostatic sites and patients presenting an isolated elevation of PSA after radical treatments. These patients are expected to be treated for a long time, since they have a rather low risk of disease progression and there is no recommended time limit for LHRH analogue therapy. The long-term adverse effects of androgen deprivation therapy, therefore, deserve more attention than they have received in the past. Osteoporosis represents a special concern for men with prostate cancer receiving androgen deprivation therapy. The rate of bone loss in these men seems to markedly exceed that associated with menopause in women, and fractures occur more frequently than in the healthy elderly male population. Serial bone mineral density (BMD) evaluation could allow the detection of patients with prostate cancer who are at greater risk of osteoporosis and adverse skeletal events after androgen deprivation therapy, such as patients already osteopenic or osteoporotic at baseline and men with rapid bone loss during treatment. BMD evaluated during treatment could also be a potential surrogate parameter of antiosteoporotic therapeutic efficacy. Treatment of bone loss induced by androgen deprivation comprises general prevention measures, antiosteoporotic drugs and the use of alternative endocrine therapies. Optimising lifestyle and diet is important, although it cannot completely prevent bone loss. Patients with nonsevere bone disease may benefit from calcium and vitamin D supplements. Men who are osteoporotic before androgen deprivation or men becoming osteoporotic during treatment and/or experiencing adverse skeletal events may also require bisphosphonates. The effectiveness of these drugs in preventing fractures has been shown in a single randomised study involving patients with osteoporosis, but it has not yet been established in a prostatic cancer population without bone metastases given androgen deprivation therapy. Different forms of endocrine therapy such as low-dose estrogens, antiandrogens and intermittent androgen ablation are under investigation. They could offer the advantage of avoiding (or limiting) treatment-related bone loss. In our opinion, however, the data available so far are not robust enough to recommend these alternative endocrine therapies instead of standard androgen deprivation in routine clinical practice","","","","","","191202 [pii]","Oncologia Medica, Azienda Ospedaliera San Luigi, Orbassano, Italy","PM:12495366","","","",""

This provides a rationale for the use of bisphosphonates to treat bone pain and prevent skeletal complications. Methods: The fasting urinary levels of calcium, hydroxyproline (OHPRO), pyridinolines (PYD), deoxypyridinolines (DPYD), collagen cross-linked N-telopeptide (NTX) and the serum values of calcium, total alkaline phosphatase and relevant bone isoenzyme, bone gla protein (BGP), carboxy-telopeptide of type I collagen (ICTP) and parathyroid hormone (PTH) were determined at baseline and on the 15th, 30th, 60th and 90th days after single-dose (90 mg) pamidronate administration in 35 consecutive prostate cancer patients with bone metastases. These biochemical indices and serum interleukin 6 (IL-6) were also measured after four days in the last consecutive 17 cases. Results: PYD, DPYD and NTX showed a significant decrease lasting four weeks (p<0.01, <0.01 and <0.001, respectively). OHPRO and ICTP did not change significantly. The NTX decline was greater than that of PYD and DPYD (maximum percent decrease: -71.3, -23.1 and -28.2, respectively). Bone formation markers and serum calcium did not change significantly. Serum PTH showed a rapid initial increase followed by a slow decrease (p<0.001). DPYD and NTX patterns did not correlate with changes in bone pain. As observed in the last 17 cases, the maximum osteolysis inhibition after pamidronate occurred on the fourth day after drug infusion. Serum IL-6 levels showed a short-lived decrease preceded by a transient rise on the fourth day. Conclusions: Pamidronate is able to induce a decrease in bone resorption without significantly influencing bone formation. The maximum decrease in bone resorption occurs very early. NTX is the most sensitive bone resorption marker in bisphosphonate therapy monitoring. Changes in IL-6 but not bone resorption markers may be useful in the prediction of symptomatic response","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We evaluated the frequency of SREs in 200 hormone-refractory patients consecutively observed at our Institution and followed until death or the last follow-up. Baseline parameters were evaluated in univariate and multivariate analysis as potential predictive factors of SREs. Skeletal-related events were observed in 86 patients (43.0%), 10 of which (5.0%) occurred before the onset of hormone-refractory disease. In univariate analysis, patient perfor mance status (P=0.002), disease extent (DE) in bone (P=0.0001), bone pain (P=0.0001), serum alkaline phosphatase (P=0.0001) and urinary N-telopeptide of type one collagen (P=0.0001) directly correlated with a greater risk to develop SREs, whereas Gleason score at diagnosis, serum PSA, Hb, serum albumin, serum calcium, types of bone lesions and duration of androgen deprivation therapy did not. Both DE in bone (hazard ratio (HR): 1.16, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.07-1.25, P=0.000) and pain score (HR: 1.13, 95% CI: 1.06-1.20, P=0.000) were independent variables predicting for the onset of SREs in multivariate analysis. In patients with heavy tumour load in bone and great bone pain, the percentage of SREs was almost twice as high as (26 vs 52%, P<0.02) and occurred significantly earlier (P=0.000) than SREs in p atients with limited DE in bone and low pain. Bone pain and DE in bone independently predict the occurrence of SREs in bone metastatic prostate cancer patients with hormone-refractory disease. These findings could help physicians in tailoring the skeletal follow-up most appropriate to individual patients and may prove useful for stratifying patients enrolled in bisphosphonate clinical trials.

While Southwest Oncology Group trial 99-16 demonstrated a survival improvement of DE over MP, the study also was designed to compare the palliation of disease-related symptoms. METHODS: Pain palliation and global quality of life (QOL) were the two primary patient-reported outcomes. Pain was measured with the Present Pain Intensity scale of the McGill Pain Questionnaire-Short Form. The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Core Quality of Life Questionnaire C30 (QLQ-C30) and its Prostate Cancer Module (PR25) measured QOL and symptom status. Pain and analgesic use were measured at random assignment, every cycle for eight cycles, and 1 year from random assignment; the QLQ-C30 and the PR25 were administered at random assignment, before cycle four (week 10) and cycle eight (month 6) and at 1 year. In addition to the primary intent-to-treat, missing at random analysis, sensitivity analyses were performed to assess robustness of global QOL conclusions under alternative informative missing data assumptions. RESULTS: Six hundred seventy four eligible patients received DE (n = 338) or MP (n = 336). In an intention-to-treat analysis, median overall survival was 17.5 months for the DE arm and 15.6 months for the MP arm (P = .02). There were no statistically significant differences in pain palliation between the treatment arms. The sensitivity analyses showed a consistent lack of statistically significant global QOL differences for the two arms. CONCLUSION: DE had superior clinical efficacy (overall survival, time-to-progression, and prostate-specific antigen declines) with similar global QOL and pain palliation in the MP arm","","","","","","24/18/2828 [pii];10.1200/JCO.2005.04.8207 [doi]","University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195-7266, USA. donnalb@u.washington.edu","PM:16782921","","","",""

METHODS: The literature was searched to identify RCTs or meta-analyses comparing treatment with bisphosphonates to placebo or no treatment. RESULTS: Ten trials that studied clodronate (five trials, 404 patients), pamidronate (two trials, 350 patients), alendronate (one trial, 49 patients), etidronate (one trial, 51 patients), and zoledronic acid (one trial, 643 patients) in men with HRPC and bone metastases met the eligibility criteria. Pain response was the most frequently reported primary outcome (eight trials). Only the smallest trial demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in pain, but other non-statistically significant trends and subgroup analyses showing improvement in pain were observed in six clodronate and pamidronate trials. Three trials reported skeletal-related events (SREs). A trial studying zoledronic acid reported a statistically and clinically significant reduction in the number of patients having at least one SRE; however, there were higher rates of some adverse effects, and quality of life was not improved. CONCLUSION: Zoledronic acid appears to reduce the number of patients having at least one SRE in men with bone metastases from HRPC that are causing minimal or no pain. This benefit should be weighed against the associated toxicities, and the neutral effect on quality of life. Bisphosphonates may reduce bone pain in men with HRPC, but the evidence is less robust. Further investigations to identify the role of bisphosphonates alone and in combination with other therapies proven effective for men with HRPC are warranted","","","","","","","Toronto-Sunnybrook Regional Cancer Centre, Toronto, Ontario, Canada","PM:16952326","","","",""

METHODS: Twenty-five patients with advanced HRPC received weekly docetaxel 30 mg/m2: in 18 patients with symptomatic bone metastases and normal renal function, docetaxel was combined with zoledronic acid, 4 mg i.v. every 4 weeks. Premedication consisted of intravenous dexamethasone before docetaxel. No oral steroids were given. RESULTS: Overall, 12 patients (48%) had a PSA response (reduction of 50% or more compared to baseline). A PSA response was achieved in 8/18 patients (44%) receiving concomitant docetaxel and zoledronic acid, and in 7/12 patients (58%) receiving docetaxel and zoledronic acid as first-line therapy. The weekly schedule of docetaxel resulted in a mean received dose intensity of 26 mg/m2/week, or 87% of the planned dose intensity. Toxicity was mild and as expected for docetaxel. The median time to progression was 7 months, and the median overall survival was 16 months.

There are increasing options for both first- and second-line therapy in the palliative treatment of patients with HRPC. Medications to control symptoms should first be optimized in patients with late-stage disease, and radiotherapy applied to dominant painful bone lesions. Docetaxel, mitoxantrone, satraplatin, and ixabepilone are active chemotherapeutic agents in the first- and/ or second-line setting for patients with HRPC, and this may be true also of older drugs such as oral cyclophosphamide and vinorelbine. Radioisotopes such as strontium and samarium are useful for treatment of more generalized bone pain. Third-line hormonal maneuvers including glucoc orticoids, ketoconazole, and estrogens can lead to further palliation in some patients, and there are provocative data that chemotherapy might restore hormonal sensitivity in a subset of patients.

Improved understanding of the underlying molecular drivers of PCa pathogenesis, progression and resistance development has provided the fundamental basis for rational targeted drug design. Key findings in recent years include the identification of ETS gene rearrangements, the dissection of PCa molecular heterogeneity and the discovery that castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) remains androgen driven despite the androgen-depleted milieu, thus making androgen receptor (AR) signaling a continued focus of molecularly targeted treatments. AR ligand-independent activation of tyrosine kinase prosurvival signaling cascades and angiogenesis have also been implicated in disease progression. A multitude of new molecularly targeted agents that abrogate AR signaling, inhibit the mitogenic and prosurvival signal transduction pathways, perturb the tumor-bone microenvironment, impair tumor vasculature, facilitate immune modulation and induce apoptosis are in clinical development and are highly likely to change the current treatment paradigm. It is clear that the success of these molecular targeted therapies hinges in part on optimal patient selection based on the molecular disease profile and an improved understanding of the mechanistic basis of acquired r esistance. This review outlines the current clinical development of molecular targeted treatments in CRPC, with particular emphasis on agents that are in the later stages of clinical development, and details the challenges and future direction of developing these antitumor agents.

To the authors' knowledge, little information exists in the literature regarding patterns of disease and response to treatment. The authors wished to define the clinical features of this patient group. METHODS: The British Association of Urological Surgeons Cancer Registry 2000 and 2001 data bases were used to identify the clinical features and outcome of 33 men with metastatic prostate carcinoma who presented with serum PSA levels < 10 ng/mL. Clinical notes and histopathology were reviewed for each patient. RESULTS: Seventeen patients (51%) presented with urinary symptoms and/or pelvic pain, 6% with cachexia and 21% with bone pain. Characteristic bone metastases were present in 81% of patients, similar to the presentation of men with high serum PSA levels. Hypercalcemia was a feature in 9% of patients. Visceral metastases were present in two patients. The median response duration to first-line hormone manipulation was 7 months. No responses were seen in 11 of 13 patients who received second-line hormones or to any third-line treatment. Three of 5 patients who received chemotherapy responded but developed recurrent disease within 8 weeks of treatment cessation. The median overall survival was 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: The presentation of patients with treatment-naive PSA-negative metastatic prostate carcinoma is similar to that of patients with high serum PSA levels, but their median survival and response duration to first-line hormone therapy are of much shorter duration. Second-line hormone therapy is ineffective, but early chemotherapy may be beneficial. Hypercalcemia is a particular feature in this group of patients","","","","","","10.1002/cncr.11821 [doi]","Prostate Cancer Research Center, The Institute of Urology, University College London, London, United Kingdom. alison_birtle@hotmail.com","PM:14635070","","","",""

METHODS: Eighty-two patients were randomly assigned to receive prednisone plus gefitinib (pG; n = 44) or prednisone plus placebo (ppl; n = 38). On progression, patients initially assigned to placebo were offered the possibility to receive gefitinib. Best prostate-specific antigen response was the primary endpoint. RESULTS: At a median follow-up time of 29.0 months (26.0-32.0), 77 patients progressed and 51 died. Prostate-specific antigen response was recorded in 6/38 (15.8%; 95% CI 4.2-27.4) and in 5/44 (11.4%; 95% CI 2.0-20.8) patients in pG and ppl groups, respectively. There was no difference between groups in time to progression (median pG 4.0 months, range 3.5-4.5; median ppl 4.5 months, range 3.5-5.0) and survival (median pG 26.5 months, range 16.0-37.0; median ppl 20.5 months, range 14.0-27.0).

There was no overall consensus as to the standard of care in clinically apparent locally advanced prostate cancer. It was agreed, however, that hormonal therapy (e.g. with a gonadotrophin releasing hormone analogue [GnRHa]) represents a valid treatment in these patie nts. Treatment practices and regimens vary considerably between European countries, but GnRHa is widely used, either alone or in combination with antiandrogens. Hormonal therapy alone is a valid option, though the optimal modality, timing and duration of treatment remain to be defined. Adjuvant therapy with a GnRHa has been shown to improve survival in patients undergoing external beam radiotherapy. It is a viable option after prostatectomy in patients with persistent or secondary relapsing PSA. It was determined that optimal treatment will be different according to PSA, clinical staging and Gleason score, and the treatment of locally advanced disease should be indiv idually tailored after discussion between physician and patient. In many instances, patients prefer and expect some form of treatment in preference to watchful waiting. Treatment nomograms such as the Kattan nomograms provide precise, comprehensive and invaluable tools for everyday use and may be used to predict outcomes and guide treatment decisions","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A 90mg dose of pamidronate administered in a 2- to 24-hour infusion achieves normocalcemia in >90% of unselected patients. Zoledronate (zoledronic acid) is more effective than pamidronate in normalising calcium levels in patients with tumor-induced hypercalcemia, at least in patients without bone metastases; however, zoledronate should be used with caution in patients with renal insufficiency. Pamidronate can be safely administered in hypercalcemic patients with renal insufficiency. Clinically meaningful bone pain relief occurs in about half of patients treated with pamidronate. Pamidronate also achieved significantly better pain control than placebo in patients with breast cancer (bone metastases) or myeloma, in 2-year placebo-controlled trials. Pamidronate 90mg administered over 2 hours every 3-4 weeks for 2 years has been shown to reduce the frequency of skeletal-related events in patients with bone metastases from breast cancer by up to 40% and in patients with multiple myeloma by nearly 50%. In the largest randomized double-blind trial that compared zoledronate 4 or 8mg with pamidronate 90mg every 3-4 weeks in patients with breast cancer or myeloma, the primary efficacy endpoint (proportion of patients experiencing at least one skeletal-related event) was similar in all three treatment groups. The 8mg dose of zoledronate had to be lowered to 4mg during the trial because of renal toxicity. Indeed, concern about the renal toxicity of zoledronate has led authorities to recommend controlling serum creatinine levels before each infusion. When the data were analyzed by a complex multiple-event analysis, the hazard ratio for developing a bone complication was reduced by about 16% in patients treated with zoledronate compared with pamidronate after 2 years of therapy. This superiority of zoledronate was observed in the breast cancer subgroup but not in myeloma patients. However, multiple-event analyses rely on assumptions that are not unanimously accepted. The short duration of zoledronate infusion (15 minutes compared with 1.5-2 hours for pamidronate) is its most evident advantage, but cost savings have not been confirmed so far in limited micro-costing analyses. Positive effects of pamidronate therapy on bone mass have been shown in patients with prostate cancer who are undergoing androgen-blockade therapy; antineoplastic therapy-induced bone loss was prevented. S tudies with bisphosphonates are ongoing in breast cancer patients receiving aromatase inhibitors for the prevention of cancer treatment-induced bone loss. Zoledronate appears to be more potent than pamidronate for the prevention of endocrine therapy-induced bone loss. (c) 2005 Adis Data Information BV.

Bone destruction is essentially mediated by the osteoclasts, the formation and activity of which are stimulated by tumor secretory products. Bisphosphonates are able to interrupt the vicious circle between metastatic cancer cells and bone cells/bone matrix by inducing osteoclast apoptosis. For breast cancer patients with metastatic disease and radiographic evidence of bone destruction, current gu idelines consist in the administration of either pamidronate 90 mg over 2 h or zoledronic acid 4 mg over 15 min every 3-4 weeks. Other bisphosphonates were not considered. Nevertheless, placebo-controlled trials have established that, when administered over a prolonged period by the oral route (clodronate and ibandronate) or by the intravenous route (pamidronate, ibandronate, and zoledronic acid), bisphosphonates reduce the skeletal morbidity rate by 25-40% in breast cancer metastatic to the skeleton. It has been shown in a 2-year controlled comparative trial between pamidronate and zoledronic acid that this latter compound has a superior efficacy in breast cancer but not in myeloma. Zoledronic acid is also the only bisphosphonate whose activity has been demonstrated in hormone-refractory metastatic prostate cancer. Serum creatinine has to be checked before each zoledronic acid infusion. Lastly, the long-term consequences on bone health of a prolonged therapy with very potent bisphosphonates remain poorly known and some experts prefer to adjust therapy to the individual patient, even more that the recently described cases of osteonecrosis of the jaw appear to be partly due to excessive bisphosphonate therapy.

BPs are now the standard treatment for cancer hypercalcemia, for which a dose of 90 mg of pamidronate or 1500 mg of clodronate is recommended; the former compound is more potent and has a longer lasting effect. Repeated pamidronate infusions exert clinically relevant analgesic effects in more than half of patients with metastatic bone pain. Recent data suggest that non-responding patients should perhaps be treated with higher doses. The optimal dose actually remains to be defined, especially as it is thought that it is probably a function of the disease stage. Regular pamidronate infusions can also achieve a partial objective response according to conventional UICC criteria and they can almost double the objective response rate to chemotherapy. Lifelong administration of oral clodronate to patients with breast cancer metastatic to bone reduces the frequency of morbid skeletal events by more than one-fourth. Two double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trials comparing monthly 90 mg pamidronate infusions to placebo infusions for 1-2 years in addition to hormone or chemotherapy in patients with at least one lytic bone metastasis have shown that the mean skeletal morbidity rate could be reduced by 30-40%. The results obtained with intravenous BPs are generally viewed as better than those obtained with oral clodronate. However, preference can be given to the oral route when BPs are started early in the process of metastatic bone disease in a patient receiving hormone therapy. According to the recently published ASCO guidelines, pamidronate 90 mg i.v. delivered over 2 h every 3-4 weeks can be recommended in patients with metastatic breast cancer who have imaging evidence of lytic destruction of bone and who are concurrently receiving systemic therapy with hormonal therapy or chemotherapy. Furthermore, the ASCO Panel considered it 'reasonable' to start i.v. BPs in women with localized pain whose bone scans were abnormal and plain radiographs normal, but not when an abnormal bone scan is asymptomatic. The pertinence of these criteria is discussed below. Because BPs are providing supportive care, reducing the rate of skeletal morbidity but evidently not abolishing it, the criteria for stopping their administration have to be different from those used for classic antineoplastic drugs, and they should not be stopped when metastatic bone disease is progressing. However, criteria to determine whether and for how long an individual patient benefits from their administration are lacking. New biochemical markers of bone resorption might help identify those patients continuing to benefit from therapy. Even better results have been achieved in patients with multiple myeloma, and the general consensus is that BPs should be started as soon as the diagnosis of lytic disease is made in myeloma patients. On the other hand, data are scanty in prostate cancer, but large-scale trials with potent BPs are ongoing or planned in such patients. Similar results to those achieved with pamidronate have been obtained with monthly 6-mg infusions of the newer BP ibandronate in patients with breast cancer metastatic to bone. The tolerance of ibandronate could be better, and the drug has the potential to be administered as a 15- to 30-min infusion. Zoledronate can also be administered safely as a 15-min 4-mg infusion, and large scale phase III trials have just been completed. These newer BPs will simplify the current therapeutic schemes and improve the cost-effectiveness ratio; they also have the potential to improve the therapeutic efficacy, at least in patients with an aggressive osteolytic disease or when given as adjuvant therapy. For that matter, initial data with clodronate indicate that they have the potential to prevent the development of bone metastases, but the use of BPs in the adjuvant setting must still be viewed as experimental","","","","","","10.1007/s005200100292 [doi]","Department of Medicine, Institut J.

Bone lesions associated with metastases are traditionally classified radiologically as either osteolytic or osteoblastic, and both types of lesions are associated with elevated levels of specific bone resorption markers. Some common aspects in the pathophysiology of bone lesions have prompted speculation that treatments for osteolytic metastases might also be effective for predominantly osteoblastic metastases, such as in prostate cancer. Potent osteoclast activity inhibitors, bisphosphonates have been successful in the treatment of osteolytic tumor bone disease. Zoledronic acid is the first bisphosphonate shown to have a direct clinical benefit in the treatment of osteoblastic bone metastases, reducing the number and rate of skeletal events in prostate cancer patients with metastatic bone disease. Moreover, the shorter, more convenient infusion time and similar safety profile of 4 mg zoledronic acid compared with 90 mg pamidronate presently make zoledronic acid the preferred therapy for treatment of bone metastases in patients with all types of advanced malignancy","","","","","","S0960977603801625 [pii]","Supportive Care Clinic and Clinic of Endocrinology and Bone Diseases, Institut J.

It discusses practical recommendations and possible future indications for bisphosphonate therapy. The current aims of bisphosphonates for metastatic bone disease are to prevent skeletal-related events (SREs), reduce bone pain and improve quality of life. Phase III clinical trials of clodronate and pamidronate have established their efficacy against bone complications in patients with breast cancer and multiple myeloma, while randomized trials have shown SRE reductions with zoledronic acid in patients with breast cancer and multiple myeloma, prostate cancer, and lung and other solid tumors. These bisphosphonates also have some effect on metastatic bone pain. Ibandronate is a new aminobisphosphonate, available in more than 40 countries outside of the US as intravenous and oral formulations for the prevention of skeletal events in patients with breast cancer and bone metastases. Phase III studies have shown that both intravenously and orally administered ibandronate have efficacy for the prevention of skeletal events and for the reduction of metastatic bone pain. In addition to efficacy, the long-term tolerability of bisphosphonates in metastatic bone disease influences drug selection. Besides their use in patients with established bone metastases, recent and ongoing research suggests that bisphosphonates also have clinical benefit in the adjuvant setting, and for the treatment of cancer-treatment-induced bone loss. Such interesting new developments may underpin a new era of bisphosphonate use sometime in the near future","","","","","","10.1007/s00520-005-0913-5 [doi]","Department of Internal Medicine, Institut Jules Bordet, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Belgium. jj.body@bordet.be","PM:16450087","","","",""

Comparative trials in this setting between zoledronic acid and denosumab have shown superior (in breast and in prostate cancer) or noninferior (in other solid tumors) skeletal-related event-prevention activity for denosumab. Osteonecrosis of the jaw is the most important side-effect of both compounds. Recent data also indicate the potential of zoledronic acid to reduce the recurrence rate in breast cancer.

Mitoxantrone has been used in the past for palliation, but it does not prolong survival. It was recently demonstrated that docetaxel is able to improve median survival as compared to mitoxantrone. We, therefore, wanted to evaluate a docetaxel-based regimen, with regard to efficacy and tolerability, in men with HRPC at our institution. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with progressive HRPC (new metastatic lesions or PSA progression) and no prior cytotoxic chemotherapy received the following treatment administered in 21-day cycles: 280 mg estramustine three times daily on days 1 to 5 and 7 to 11, 70 mg docetaxel per square meter of body surface area on day 2, and 10 mg prednisone once daily throughout the course. After four cycles, the patients were re-evaluated via PSA, blood counts, CT and bone scans. If no progression had occurred, two more cycles were given. Objective response rates, post-treatment declines in serum PSA levels, as well as side-effects, were recorded. RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients with HRPC (age range 43-79 years, average 65 years) were enrolled after informed consent. The median PSA in this cohort was 144 (1.5-3030) ng/ml. The percentage of patients with bone and lymph node metastases was 82% and 61.5%, respectively. During an average follow-up period of 11 months, 20 patients (64.5%) showed a response to therapy, including a complete (CR), partial (PR) or mixed (MR) response, stable disease (SD) of metastatic lesions, or a PSA response. A post-therapeutic decrease of serum PSA levels of >25%, >50% and >75% occurred in 26.1%, 21.7% and 26.1% of patients, respectively. Lymph node metastases responded better to therapy (73%) than bone metastases (42%). Regarding toxicity, the regimen was generally well tolerated. Only three patients showed adverse events (one grade 4 neutropenia, one dermatological and one as a result of pain), which led to therapy withdrawal. Minor adverse events included nausea, alopecia and fatigue. No cardiovascular events were reported. CONCLUSION: Although the patients included in the present study had advanced disease, responses were promising and toxicity was tolerable. These preliminary data support the findings of recently published studies and suggest that docetaxel-based chemotherapy is going to play an important role as a regimen for patients with HRPC","","","","","","","Department of Urology, University of Tuebingen Medical Center, Tuebingen, Germany","PM:16334130","","","",""

OBJECTIVES: Our objectives were to examine the effect of ESAs and identify factors that modify the effects of ESAs on overall survival, progression free survival, thromboembolic and cardiovascular events as well as need for transfusions and other important safety and efficacy outcomes in cancer patients. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Library, Medline, Embase and conference proceedings for eligible trials. Manufacturers of ESAs were contacted to identify additional trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials comparing epoetin or darbepoetin plus red blood cell transfusions (as necessary) versus red blood cell transfusions (as necessary) alone, to prevent or treat anemia in adult or pediatric cancer patients with or without concurrent antineoplastic therapy. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We performed a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials comparing epoetin alpha, epoetin beta or darbepoetin alpha plus red blood cell transfusions versus transfusion alone, for prophylaxis or therapy of anemia while or after receiving anti-cancer treatment. Patient-level data were obtained and analyzed by independent statisticians at two academic departments, using fixed-effects and random-effects meta-analysis. Analyses were according to the intention-to-treat principle. Primary endpoints were on study mortality and overall survival during the longest available follow-up, regardless of anticancer treatment, and in patients receiving chemotherapy. Tests for interactions were used to identify differences in effects of ESAs on mortality across pre-specified subgroups. The present review reports only the results for the primary endpoint. MAIN RESULTS: A total of 13933 cancer patients from 53 trials were analyzed, 1530 patients died on-study and 4993 overall. ESAs increased on study mortality (combined hazard ratio [cHR] 1.17; 95% CI 1.06-1.30) and worsened overall survival (cHR 1.06; 95% CI 1.00-1.12), with little heterogeneity between trials (I2 0%, p=0.87 and I2 7.1%, p=0.33, respectively). Thirty-eight trials enrolled 10441 patients receiving chemotherapy. The cHR for on study mortality was 1.10 (95% CI 0.98-1.24) and 1.04; 95% CI 0.97-1.11) for overall survival. There was little evidence for a difference between trials of patients receiving different cancer treatments (P for interaction=0.42). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: ESA treatment in cancer patients increased on study mortality and worsened overall survival. For patients undergoing chemotherapy the increase was less pronounced, but an adverse effect could not be excluded. ANTI-ANEMIA DRUGS SHORTEN SURVIVAL FOR SOME CANCER PATIENTS: People with cancer may develop a blood problem called anemia, due to the treatment or from the disease itself. They will have very low levels of healthy red blood cells, causing additional health problems. For years, doctors have tried to prevent or treat anemia with injections of erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) in order to spare cancer patients the many serious harms associated with a red-blood cell transfusion (such as hepatitis, transfusion-related acute lung injury, infection). Earlier reviews of the research showed that ESA treatment reduces the need for transfusion but, in recent years, several studies have shown that ESAs themselves cause harm. The drug may, for example, stimulate tumor growth and cause potentially fatal blood clots. In 2007, new studies reported that ESAs shortens survival in people with breast, non-small cell lung, head and neck, lymphoid and cervical cancers.A new systematic review was needed to evaluate the old and the new evidence together and determine the impact of ESAs on survival in cancer patients to see if there are groups of patients who are at increased or decreased risk compared to the average. To accomplish this the authors of this meta-analysis conducted an in-depth assessment of the individual patient data generated by the care of nearly 14,000 patients from 53 trials conducted worldwide. Data on each of these patients were provided by three companies that make ESAs: Amgen, Johnson & Johnson, and Roche, and by several independent researchers. (The drug companies, however, had no role in conducting the meta-analysis.) The trials investigated one of two types of ESAs, epoetin or darbepoetin, and compared the use of one of these drugs plus red blood cell transfusion (as needed), with red blood cell transfusion alone (as needed). Most patients were given their treatment while undergoing anti-cancer therapy (chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy); but others received the treatment after they had completed their anti-cancer therapy. Some patients already had anemia; others were treated in order to prevent it. The patients had many different forms of cancer and many different anti-cancer treatments. The authors of this new meta-analysis concluded that ESA treatment shortens survival. They could not identify with certainty any subgroup of patients at either increased or decreased risk of dying when taking ESAs. With their doctors' help, cancer patients should consider the risks of taking ESA against the risks of a blood transfusion. Be aware, however, that uncertainties remain about the magnitude of each","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this report, we present the 10-year results. METHODS: For this open-label randomised trial, eligible patients were younger than 80 years and had newly diagnosed histologically proven T1-2 prostatic adenocarcinoma with WHO histological grade 3 or T3-4 prostatic adenocarcinoma of any histological grade, and a WHO performance status of 0-2. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive radiotherapy alone or radiotherapy plus immediate androgen suppression. Treatment allocation was open label and used a minimisation algorithm with institution, clinical stage of the disease, results of pelvic-lymph-node dissection, and irradiation fields extension as minimisation factors. Patients were irradiated externally, once a day, 5 days a week, for 7 weeks to a total dose of 50 Gy to the whole pelvis, with an additional 20 Gy to the prostate and seminal vesicles. The LHRH agonist, goserelin acetate (3.6 mg subcutaneously every 4 weeks), was started on the first day of irradiation and continued for 3 years; cyproterone acetate (50 mg orally three times a day) was given for 1 month starting a week before the first goserelin injection. The primary endpoint was clinical disease-free survival. Analysis was by intention to treat. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00849082. FINDINGS: Between May 22, 1987, and Oct 31, 1995, 415 patients were randomly assigned to treatment groups and were included in the analysis (208 radiotherapy alone, 207 combined treatment). Median follow-up was 9.1 years (IQR 5.1-12.6). 10-year clinical disease-free survival was 22.7% (95% CI 16.3-29.7) in the radiotherapy-alone group and 47.7% (39.0-56.0) in the combined treatment group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.42, 95% CI 0.33-0.55, p<0.0001). 10-year overall survival was 39.8% (95% CI 31.9-47.5) in patients receiving radiotherapy alone and 58.1% (49.2-66.0) in those allocated combined treatment (HR 0.60, 95% CI 0.45-0.80, p=0.0004), and 10-year prostate-cancer mortality was 30.4% (95% CI 23.2-37.5) and 10.3% (5.1-15.4), respectively (HR 0.38, 95% CI 0.24-0.60, p<0.0001). No significant difference in cardiovascular mortality was noted between treatment groups both in patients who had cardiovascular problems at study entry (eight of 53 patients in the combined treatment group had a cardiovascular-related cause of death vs 11 of 63 in the radiotherapy group; p=0.60) and in those who did not (14 of 154 vs six of 145; p=0.25). Two fractures were reported in patients allocated combined treatment. INTERPRETATION: In patients with prostate cancer with high metastatic risk, immediate androgen suppression with an LHRH agonist given during and for 3 years after external irradiation improves 10-year disease-free and overall survival without increasing late cardiovascular toxicity","","","","","","S1470-2045(10)70223-0 [pii];10.1016/S1470-2045(10)70223-0 [doi]","Radiotherapy Department, University Hospital, Grenoble, France.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between December 2002 and January 2008, 11 patients had SRARP with pelvic lymph node dissection by one surgeon from one institution. Six patients had brachytherapy, three had external beam RT (EBRT), one intensity-modulated RT, and one received brachytherapy with an EBRT boost. All patients had prostate cancer on biopsy after RT, with negative computed tomography and bone scan. The mean (range) follow-up was 20.5 (1-77) months. RESULTS: The mean interval from RT to SRARP was 53.2 months; the mean preoperative prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level was 5.2 ng/mL, the operative duration 183 min and the estimated blood loss 113 mL. One patient had prolonged lymphatic drainage, one had an anastomotic leak, and one had an anastomotic stricture requiring direct vision internal urethrotomy at 3 months. The mean duration of catheterization was 10.4 days and the hospital stay 1.4 days. Three patients had a biochemical recurrence, at 1, 2 and 43 months. In one of two patients with node-positive carcinoma of the prostate the PSA level failed to reach a nadir of zero after surgery. In patients with a minimum follow-up of 2 months, eight of 10 are continent (defined as zero to one pad per day) and two have erections adequate for intercourse with the use of phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors. CONCLUSION: SRARP after RT-resistant disease recurrence is feasible with minimal perioperative morbidity. Early functional outcomes appear to be at least equivalent with historical salvage RP series. Robotic extended pelvic lymph node dissection is safe and can improve the accuracy of surgical staging. A longer follow-up is necessary to better assess the functional and oncological outcomes","","","","","","BJU8245 [pii];10.1111/j.1464-410X.2008.08245.x [doi]","Vattikuti Urology Institute, Henry Ford Health System, Detroit, MI 48202, USA","PM:19076132","","","",""

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 55 consecutive patients at high risk of locally advanced disease [prostate-specific antigen (PSA) > 10 ng/ml, Gleason score 7 or worse on biopsy, normal (99m) Tc bone scan] underwent either a pelvic MRI (n = 42) or CT (n = 13) scan and subsequent LPLND. Preoperative staging was compared to the histology of the lymph node specimens obtained. RESULTS: A total of 20/55 (36.4%) patients had pelvic lymph node metastases confirmed by LPLND. MRI identified three patients (27.3%) with pelvic lymph node metastases and missed eight (72.7%) whilst CT identified none of nine patients with pelvic lymph node metastases. The groups with histologically-positive and -negative nodes had similar mean ages (63 vs 65 years; p = 0.52), Gleason scores (6.8 vs 6.5; p = 0.41) and PSA levels (43.1 vs 31.4 ng/ml; p = 0.56). CONCLUSION: The presence or absence of lymph node metastases has critical implications for the prognosis and treatment of prostate cancer. In this study both MRI and CT missed many cases of lymph node metastases in 'high-risk' patients. While a positive scan seems likely to indicate nodal metastases, the low sensitivity in high-risk patients seems unacceptable if treatment decisions are to be based on accurate staging, and LPLND offers an alternative","","","","","","10.1080/00365590310006309 [doi];MCGA49CJGGWX6Q0T [pii]","Department of Urology, King's College Hospital, Denmark Hill, London SE5 9RS, UK. nigelborley@hotmail.com","PM:14594685","","","",""

The past 20 years, with the introduction of prostate-specific antigen (PSA), has seen prostate cancer move increasingly from a condition that presented with locally advanced disease or metastases to one that is found upon screening. More is also known about the pathology of pre-malignant lesions. Diagnosis relies on trans-rectal ultrasound (TRUS) to obtain biopsies from throughout the prostate, but TRUS is not useful for staging. Imaging for staging, such as magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography, still has a low accuracy compared with pathological specimens. Current techniques are also inaccurate in identifying lymph node and bony metastases. Nomograms have been developed from the PSA, Gleason score and clinical grading to help quantify the risk of extra-capsular extension in radical prostatectomy specimens. Improved clinical staging modalities are required for more reliable prediction of pathological stage and for monitoring of response to treatments","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A multidisciplinary approach is required to improve survival, minimise complications, and provide adequate palliation. Radiotherapy remains the mainstay of treatment for pelvic disease control and encouraging results have been reported with androgen ablation as adjuvant therapy. In metastatic disease androgen ablation is usually first line, although ultimately most tumours become hormone refractory, requiring second or third line treatments. Localised or systemic radiotherapy may be used for pallia tion in metastatic disease. With the advent of more potent bisphosphonates the common bony complications associated with metastases may be reduced.

This review highlights the most important recent developments. RECENT FINDINGS: Prostate cancer: PET imaging with the new radiotracers C-choline, F-fluorocholine, and C-acetate show promising results. The role of anti-1-amino-3-F-fluorocyclobutane-1 -carboxylic acid remains to be elucidated further. F-fluoride PET is useful for the detection of bone metastases. Bladder cancer: F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET/CT with delayed images after a diuretic and oral hydration may improve detection of locally recurrent or residual bladder tumours. Both F-FDG PET and C-choline PET may be useful for staging of bladder cancer. Renal cancer: F-FDG PET has a role in staging and restaging of the disease. Recently, I-cG250 PET has shown promising results in the detection of clear-cell renal carcinoma. Testicular cancer: F-FDG PET is useful in staging and fo llow-up after treatment. There are no important recent developments with new radiopharmaceuticals in testicular cancer. SUMMARY: The utility of PET molecular imaging in uro-oncology expanded due to the new metabolic PET tracers with more favourable properties.

Metastatic prostate cancer is an attractive target for radioimmunotherapy (RIT) as no effective therapies are available. This review highlights the most important achievements within the last year in PET/CT and RIT of prostate cancer. RECENT FINDINGS: Conflicting results exist on the use of choline for detection of malignant disease in the prostate gland. The role of PET/CT in N-staging remains to be elucidated further. However, F-choline and C-choline PET/CT have been demonstrated to be useful for detection of recurrence. F-choline and F-fluoride PET/CT are useful for detection of bone metastases. Prostate tumor antigens may be used as targets for RIT. Prostate-specific membrane antigen is currently under focus of a number of diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. J591, a monoclonal antibody, which targets the extracellular domain of prostate-specific membrane antigen, shows promising results. HER2 receptors may also have a potential as target for PET/CT imaging and RIT of advanced prostate cancer. SUMMARY: PET/CT in prostate cancer has proven to play a significant role, in p articular for detection of prostate cancer recurrence and bone metastases. RIT of metastatic prostate cancer warrants further investigations. (c) 2009 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: Forty-three patients with M1 b prostate cancer were treated by intermittent hormonal deprivation using luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) analogue alone (n = 11), or associated with an antiandrogen (n = 32). The prospective nonrandomized study required an initial therapy period of 12 months with a stable biological response during 6 months (PSA, testosterone). Treatment was resumed when the serum PSA value recovered to 20 ng/ml, or when local failure or new bone metastasis occurred. The assessment of quality of life was carried out using the EORTC QLQ-C30. RESULTS: The mean follow-up time was 43.7 months. After the initial 12 months of androgen suppression, one patient with a minimal disease was off-therapy with a follow-up of 18 months. For the 42 other patients, the mean off-therapy period was 6.7 months. In the second therapy period (9-12 months), 7 patients were hormono-independent and died with a mean survival time of 27 months; 35 patients were responders. The mean off-therapy length in the second cycle was short (3.8 months). After this time, androgen suppression therapy was reintroduced permanently, but 10 patients were hormono-independent. No difference was observed in the EORTC QLQ-C30 between therapy and off-therapy periods, only a rapid decrease in adverse events due to the hormonal deprivation was reported in all cases during the off-therapy period. CONCLUSIONS: Intermittent androgen suppression in patients with M1 b prostate cancer could be associated with a significant period off-therapy in the first cycle (55.8%), and with a chance of second hormone response. But in the second cycle, the off-therapy period length was short and required a careful follow-up","","","","","","20353 [pii]","Clinique Urologique, CHU, Hotel Dieu, Nantes, France. obouchot@chu-nantes.fr","PM:11096234","","","",""

To the authors' knowledge no standard chemotherapy for patients with hormone refractory prostate carcinoma (HRPC) exists. In a prospective study, the efficacy and toxicity of an oral combination of estramustine and cyclophosphamide were evaluated. METHODS: Between March 1996 and April 1998, 32 consecutive patients (median age 74 years; range, 53-84 years) with metastatic HRPC were treated with oral estramustine (10 mg/kg/day) and oral cyclophosphamide (2 mg/kg/day) for 14 days every 28 days. Inclusion criteria were previous complete androgen blockade, antiandrogen withdrawal evaluation, and clinical or biochemical disease progression. Response assessment was based on a decrease > or =50% in the prostate specific antigen (PSA) level associated with improvement (or no worsening) in Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) and relief of bone pain (if present). RESULTS: All patients were evaluable for efficacy and toxicity. PSA levels decreased by at least 50% in 14 patients (43.7%) (95% confidence interval, 26.5-60.9), remained stable in 12 patients (37.5%), and rose in 6 patients (18.8%). ECOG PS was 0 in 5 of 14 patients, improved from 1 to 0 in 7 patients, and remained unchanged in 2 patients. Bone pain, present in 8 of 14 patients, disappeared in 7 and was partially relieved in 1. The median duration of response was 30 weeks (range, 8-88+ weeks). An objective partial response was obtained in two cases. Toxicity was mild and mainly gastrointestinal (World Health Organization [WHO] Grade 1). No cases of WHO Grade 3-4 hematologic toxicity occurred. CONCLUSIONS: The oral combination of estramustine and cyclophosphamide appears to be safe and effective in patients with HRPC. In responding patients its use shows a clinical benefit in terms of improvement of ECOG PS and pain control","","","","","","10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(20000315)88:6<1438::AID-CNCR23>3.0.CO;2-O [pii]","Department of Urology, Policlinico Hospital, Perugia, Italy","PM:10717628","","","",""

However, prognosis remains poor, with a median survival of less than 2 years. There is no standard of care for patients who progress during or after docetaxel treatment, which represents a real unmet medical need. Several small retrospective studies suggest that patients with mCRPC who responded to first-line docetaxel-based therapy are sensitive to re-treatment, but a survival benefit in prospective randomized trials has not been demonstrated. Epithelial-stromal interactions in the tumour microenvironment appear to play a central role in prostate cancer progression and response to therapy. Recent insights into the molecular mechanisms that underpin prostate cancer progression have allowed the identification of potential therapeutic targets. New agents, including angiogenesis inhibitors, hormone therapies, chemotherapies, bone targeting agents, vaccines and immunotherapies are currently undergoing clinical development in advanced prostate cancer using docetaxel as a backbone. Several Phase III studies have now been completed. Sipuleucel-T prolonged survival compared with placebo in asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients with mCRPC. Cabazitaxel plus prednisone prolonged survival in patients with mCRPC who progressed during or after docetaxel-based therapy compared with the active agent mitoxantrone, plus prednisone. Multidisciplinary management and optimization of the role and timing of new agents in this evolving treatment continuum will be critical to maximizing patient outcomes. Identification of predictive markers and better gene expression profiling will be critical to tailoring therapies to individual patients and disease states, whereas validated surrogate markers of overall survival will help accelerate drug approval","","","","","","10.1111/j.1464-410X.2010.10036.x [doi]","Department of Oncology and UOC of Medical Oncology, Ospedale San Donato, Arezzo, Italy","PM:21382150","","","",""

Preclinical and clinical studies have provided insight into the pathophysiology of bone metastases and the changes that occur in the bone microenvironment that result in a favorable site of growth for prostate cancer. We provide an overview of recent advances in understanding bone biology, and bone targeted therapy research and development. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed recent research findings related to the biology of bone metastases, approaches to targeting osteoclast function, approaches to targeting osteoblasts and advances in assessing the treatment response to bone targeted therapies in the context of prostate cancer management. RESULTS: To date targeting some of the key players in the bone microenvironment has not been associated with a significant antitumor effect or with meaningful clinical benefit in phase III randomized trials. A significant limitation in the development of bone targeted therapy has been the inability to objectively assess treatment response. Investigation of improved imaging techniques are ongoing to provide better treatment assessment and, therefore, allow more rapid drug screening and development. CONCLUSIONS: It is our recommendation that future therapy development should be combination based, focusing on simultaneous targeting of multiple relevant pathways. Most important of all is the direct targeting of prostate cancer cells","","","","","","S0022-5347(07)01094-4 [pii];10.1016/j.juro.2007.04.035 [doi]","Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109, USA","PM:17644119","","","",""

We evaluated the efficacy of two dose levels of cilengitide in patients (pts) with castrate resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Methods Chemotherapy-naive, asymptomatic metastatic CRPC pts were randomized to cilengitide 500 mg or 2,000 mg IV twice weekly using parallel 2-stage design. The primary endpoint was rate of objective clinical progression at 6-months. Secondary endpoints included clinical and PSA response rates, safety and effects of cilengitide treatment on circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and bone remodeling markers. Results Forty-four pts were accrued to first stage (22/arm). Median number of cycles was three in both arms (500 mg arm: 1-8; 2,000 mg arm: 1-15). At 6 months, two pts (9%) on the 500 mg arm and five pts (23%) on the 2,000 mg arm had not progressed. Best objective response was stable disease (SD) in seven pts for 9.9[8.1,20.9] months. There were three grade 3 and no grade 4 toxicities. At 12 weeks, analysis of bone markers did not reveal significant trends. At progression, bone specific alkaline phosphatase and N-telopeptide increased in all pts, less so in pts on the 2,000 mg arm and in pts on both arms who obtained SD at 6 months. CTCs increased over time in both arms. Conclusion Cilengitide was well tolerated with modest clinical effect in favor of the higher dose. The unique trial design including a shift from response rate to objective progression as the endpoint, and not acting on PSA increases was feasible","","","","","","10.1007/s10637-010-9420-8 [doi]","Duke University, Durham, NS, USA","PM:20336348","","","",""

A number of factors, including limited radiotherapy resources, waiting times, and patient convenience, suggest single fraction to be the treatment of choice for patients. However, international patterns of practice indicate that multiple fractions are still commonly used. This study examined whether dose-fractionation schemes used for the treatment of bone metastases at the Rapid Response Radiotherapy Program (RRRP) at the Odette Cancer Centre have changed since 1999. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review of the prospective RRRP database and hospital records were conducted for all patients treated with palliative radiotherapy for uncomplicated bone metastases at the RRRP in 1999 (or baseline), 2001, 2004 and from 1 January to 31 July 2005. Data were collected on patient demographics and clinical characteristics. RESULTS: Of the 693 patients, 65 and 35% were prescribed single fraction (predominantly single 8 Gy) and multiple fractions (predominantly 20 Gy/five fractions), respectively. The administration of single treatments generally increased over time, from 51% in 1999 to 66% in 2005 (P=0.0001). On the basis of multiple logistic regression analyses, patients were more likely to be prescribed single-fraction radiotherapy if they had prostate cancer, had a poorer performance status, were treated to the limbs, hips, shoulders, pelvis, ribs, scapula, sternum, or clavicle (compared with the spine), were treated by a radiation oncologist who had been trained in earlier years, and who were treated after 1999. CONCLUSIONS: Between 1999 and 2005, the use of single-fraction radiotherapy increased, corresponding to publications showing equal efficacy of pain relief between single and multiple fractions in the management of uncomplicated bone metastases. However, about a third of patients still received multiple fractions","","","","","","S0936-6555(08)00004-6 [pii];10.1016/j.clon.2008.01.002 [doi]","Department of Health Studies and Gerontology, Faculty of Applied Health Sciences, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada","PM:18276125","","","",""

The aim of this paper is to evaluate treatment results of our high-risk patient cohort.Patients and Methods: The cohort of 42 patients with radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen histology GS 8-10 was assessed. The patients were followed up after RP and radiotherapy (RT) was delivered in case of a biochemical relapse. Adjuvant radiotherapy (aRT) was delivered only in case of a positive surgical margin (PSM). The following parameters were evaluated: biochemical progression-free survival (BPFS), overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS). The second objective was to evaluate adverse effects of RP and RT. Results: The median f ollow-up time was 88 months (18-168). RP led to BPFS in 16 patients (38%). Five patients with PSM underwent aRT and 20 underwent salvage radiotherapy (sRT). One patient died of myocardial infarction and 1 patient died of metastatic disease. Skeletal metastases were recorded in 2 patients. The BPFS in RP combinations with sRT or aRT was reached in 29 patients (69%). The OS and CSS in our cohort reached 95 and 98%, respectively. Conclusion: Management with aRT only in PSM was very effective, according to our retrospective study. Copyright (c) 2010 S. Karger AG, Basel","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent advances in the understanding of bone remodeling mechanisms and the interdependence of cancer cells and bone have been closely associated with development of the bisphosphonate drugs and newer agents such as osteoprotegerin (OPG). The bisphosphonates are potent inhibitors of osteoclast mediated bone resorption and appear to function either by induction of apoptosis in mature osteoclasts or by inhibition of formation of osteoclasts from progenitor cells. Bisphosphonates are the treatment of choice in tumor-induced hypercalcemia. Bisphosphonates have a clear role in reducing bone pain and skeletal complications, such as pathological fracture and are being evaluated in the prevention of bone metastases. Until recently, intravenous (IV) pamidronate has been the drug most commonly prescribed for oncological indications and oral clodronate has also been widely used in some countries outside the US. However, newer and more potent drugs, such as zoledronate, are increasingly having a major impact on routine therapy. Three of the largest ever bisphosp honate trials, using zoledronate in metastatic bone disease have recently been completed. In a breast and multiple myeloma trial in 1648 patients, zoledronate (4mg IV) was shown to be equivalent to pamidronate (90mg IV) in reducing skeletal events and was more convenient to administer. In trials in prostate cancer and a wide range of other solid tumor types affecting bone, both the number of patients with skeletal-related events and the rate of bone complications were reduced. The indications for bisphosphonates are, therefore, no longer constrained by tumor type. The assessment of response to therapy is a vital part of management of metastatic bone disease. Plain radiographs and the isotope bone scan remain widely used but have many limitations. Newer imaging techniques such as computerized tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and positron emission tomography may be useful in selected situations. Recent research suggests that measurement of tumor markers and bone-specific markers will play an increasingly important role in assessment of response. In particular, bone resorption markers measuring collagen breakdown have potential as rapid, convenient, and inexpensive measures of response, with suppression of bone resorption into the normal range being an important aim of bone-specific treatments","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In oncology, their role in metastatic bone disease is well established, but there is increasing interest in their potential role in preventing and treating cancer-induced bone loss and their possible anti-tumour effects. Metastatic bone disease is associated with a variety of skeletal complications, including pathologic fractures, bone pain, impaired mobility, spinal cord compression and hypercalcaemia. Intravenous bisphosphonates, particularly zoledronic acid, in conjunction with rehydration, are now established as the treatment of choice for hypercalcaemia. For treatment of bone pain, it has also been shown that bisphosphonates can be an effective supplementary approach to radiotherapy. In breast cancer and myeloma, bisphosphonates have now become part of standard therapy to treat and prevent skeletal-related events (SRE) and, until recently, treatment was largely with intravenous pamidronate or oral clodronate. However, large, randomised, multicentre trials using intravenous administration of the highly potent bisphosphonate zoledronic acid every 3-4 weeks have recently demonstrated a reduction of 20% in the risk of developing an SRE compared with pamidronate for patients with breast cancer. Moreover, these trials have demonstrated, for the first time, that a bisphosphonate significantly reduces the occurrence of skeletal events in hormone-refractory prostate cancer and in non-small cell lung cancer and a range of other solid tumours. Investigations into the potential of the relatively low potency bisphosphonate, clodronate, for the prevention of bone metastases in breast cancer have produced conflicting data. Further large, randomised studies with clodronate and zoledronic acid are planned and until the results are available it is not possible to identify a definite adjuvant role for bisphosphonates. Evidence is accumulating in vitro that bisphosphonates are also able to directly affect tumour cells, in addition to their effects on osteoclasts, with zoledronic acid being particularly potent. Over recent decades there has been a significant improvement in cure rates and survival times in certain cancers and the use of chemotherapy and hormone therapy has expanded greatly, leading to increasing numbers of long-term survivors who have received these treatments. Management of treatment-induced bone loss is therefore assuming a greater importance and bisphosphonates represent an attractive treatment option in such patients. Several placebo-controlled trials using oral clodronate, oral risedronate, intravenous pamidronate and intravenous zoledronic acid have all now demonstrated benefits in reducing the loss in bone mineral density","","","","","","","Academic Unit of Clinical Oncology, Cancer Research Centre, Weston Park Hospital, Sheffield S10 2SJ, UK","PM:15163299","","","",""

We investigated this question in patients with bone metastases secondary to prostate cancer and to non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and other solid tumors assigned to the placebo arms of two phase III trials of zoledronic acid. METHODS: Levels of the urinary bone resorption marker N-telopeptide and the serum bone formation marker bone-specific alkaline phosphatase were assessed every 3 months for patients with prostate cancer (n = 203) or NSCLC or other solid tumors (n = 238) and were categorized as low or high. Patients were monitored for skeletal-related events, bone disease progression, and death. The relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for these outcomes were estimated for patients with high versus low levels of each marker using intensity-based multiple event and Cox regression models. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: In each disease group and overall, high levels of each marker at the beginning of the study were statistically significantly associated with an increased risk of negative outcomes. Use of recent marker assessments as time-dependent covariates gave even greater prognostic significance. High N-telopeptide levels were a stronger prognostic indicator of negative outcomes than bone-specific alkaline phosphatase levels. In recent assessments, patients with high N-telopeptide levels had an increased relative risk of skeletal-related events (prostate cancer, RR = 3.25, 95% CI = 2.26 to 4.68, P<.001; NSCLC and other solid tumors, RR = 1.79, 95% CI = 1.15 to 2.79, P = .010), disease progression (prostate cancer, RR = 2.02, 95% CI = 1.48 to 2.74, P<.001; NSCLC and other solid tumors, RR = 1.91, 95% CI = 1.16 to 3.15, P = .011), and death (prostate cancer, RR = 4.59, 95% CI = 2.82 to 7.46, P<.001; NSCLC and other solid tumors, RR = 2.67, 95% CI = 1.85 to 3.85, P<.001) compared with patients with low N-telopeptide levels. CONCLUSIONS: Baseline and recent bone marker levels were predictive of negative clinical outcomes in patients with bone metastases secondary to prostate cancer and to NSCLC and other solid tumors. N-telopeptide levels were more consistent prognostic indicators than bone-specific alkaline phosphatase for all tumor types, reflecting the key role of osteolysis in the development of skeletal complications","","","","","","97/1/59 [pii];10.1093/jnci/dji002 [doi]","Academic Unit of Clinical Oncology, Cancer Research Centre, Weston Park Hospital, Sheffield, England, United Kingdom","PM:15632381","","","",""

The bisphosphonate clodronate reduces skeletal morbidity by inhibiting bone resorption. This study investigated the use of bone markers to assess the efficacy of oral clodronate across a range of clinically relevant doses. There were 125 patients with metastatic bone disease randomized to daily oral clodronate (800, 1,600, 2,400 and 3,200 mg) or placebo in a double-blind, multicenter study. Urinary N-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (U-NTX), serum C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (S-CTX), urinary calcium (U-Ca), and bone alkaline phosphatase were measured weekly for a 6-week treatment period. Doses of >or=1,600 mg clodronate produced mean reductions of >40% in U-NTX, S-CTX and U-Ca, all significantly different from placebo (P=0.0015, 0.001, 0.0036, respectively), after 6 weeks. Evaluation of least significant changes in markers suggested that the commonly used 1,600 mg dose was most appropriate for breast cancer patients. However, this dose was suboptimal for other (mainly prostate cancer) patients, who showed better response to 2,400 mg. The number of adverse events in the treatment arms was not significantly different from that in placebo, but a higher number of patients had diarrhea in the 3,200 mg arm and withdrew from the study. This trial is the first to explore the dose-response relationship of clodronate in oncology using specific markers of bone turnover. It has confirmed that the 1,600 mg dose is safe and effective for breast cancer patients but may be suboptimal for the other tumors studied","","","","","","10.1007/s00223-007-9061-x [doi]","Academic Unit of Clinical Oncology, Weston Park Hospital University of Sheffield, Sheffield S10 2SJ, UK.

Although prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is an established biomarker in prostate cancer, it provides only limited information relating to bone metastases and the treatment of metastatic bone disease with bisphosphonates or novel noncytotoxic targeted or biological agents that may provide clinical benefits without affecting PSA levels. As bone metastases develop, factors derived from bone metabolism are released into blood and urine, including N- and C-terminal peptide fragments of type 1 collage n and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, which represent potentially useful biomarkers for monitoring metastatic bone disease. A number of clinical trials have investigated these bone biomarkers with respect to their diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive values. Results suggest that higher levels of bone biomarkers are associated with an increased risk of skeletal-related events and/or death. As a result of these findings, bone biomarkers are now being increasingly used as study end points, particularly in studies investigating novel agents with putative bone effects. Data from prospective clinical trials are needed to validate the use of bone biomarkers and to confirm that marker levels provide additional information beyond traditional m ethods of response evaluation for patients with metastatic prostate cancer.

All samples taken were for the purposes of research and molecular studies on HRPC. Twenty patients with HRPC had bone marrow aspirate and trephines taken from lesions in the posterior superior iliac spine or sacro-iliac region when shown on diagnostic 99(m)Tc-HDP bone scans. Three patients also underwent plain X-ray, 18F-positron emission tomography bone scan, pelvic MRI scan and 99(m)Tc nanocolloid bone marrow scans. These images were used to assess if the extra imaging information provided, such as three-dimensional localisation of the bone metastases, was of value for target bone metastases. Cancer cells were obtained in 15/20 (75%) cases in which a trephine biopsy was attempted and 0/20 of cases in which a bone marrow aspiration was attempted. The additional information provided by the range of other imaging investigations was of little benefit in obtaining tumour samples, but did suggest why negative biopsies were obtained in some cases after targeting with planar bone scans. We recommend the use of bone marrow trephine biopsy alone, guided by previous diagnostic 99(m)Tc planar bone scan as a practical method to obtain prostate cancer cells from bone metastases","","","","","","10.1038/sj.pcan.4500581 [doi];4500581 [pii]","Institute of Urology Research Laboratories, 67 Riding House Street, London, UK. richard.brown@ucl.ac.uk","PM:12497005","","","",""

Nevertheless, the metastatic pathways in prostate cancer are not entirely understood. Among 19,316 routine autopsies performed from 1967 to 1995 on men older than 40 years of age, the reports from those 1,589 (8.2%) with prostate cancer were analyzed. Hematogeneous metastases were present in 35% of 1,589 patients with prostate cancer, with most frequent involvement being bone (90%), lung (46%), liver (25%), pleura (21%), and adrenals (13%). Several lines of evidence suggested the existence of a backward metastatic pathway through veins from the prostate to the spine in addition to classical hematogeneous tumor spread via the vena cava. First, there was an inverse relationship between spine and lung metastases, suggesting that metastasis to the spine is independent of lung metastasis. Second, the maximum frequency of spine involvement occurred in smaller tumors (4 to 6 cm) as compared with the maximum spread to lung (6 to 8 cm) and liver (>8 cm), suggesting that spine metastases precede lung and liver metastases in many prostate cancers. Third, there was a gradual decrease in spine involvement from the lumbar to the cervical level (97% v 38%), which is consistent with a subsequent upward metastatic spread along spinal veins after initial lumbar metastasis. The results of this study show that bone, lung, and liver are the most frequent sites of distant prostate cancer metastases. Besides the cava-type of metastasis through lung passage, there are strong arguments for the existence and clinical significance of a backward venous spread to the spine, which is likely to occur early in the metastatic process","","","","","","","Institute of Pathology and Urologic Clinics, University of Basel, Switzerland","PM:10836297","","","",""

These agents are well known to cause a surge in serum testosterone levels during the first week of therapy. However, there are wide discrepancies in reports of the frequency and severity of acute clinical progression or clinical flare that might result from the testosterone surge. Also, there is not a clear consensus as to whether antiandrogens should be routinely given to all patients during the first month of LHRH therapy to prevent flare responses. METHODS: Clinical trials involving LHRH analog therapy for prostate cancer were reviewed, and the frequency of clinical flare responses noted. Particular attention was given to the kinds of clinical problems associated with the flare response. The use of LHRH analog therapy in treatment of patients with prostate cancer for indications other than overt metastatic disease is discussed, because this is becoming a much more common use of these agents. This article analyzes 2 placebo-controlled, double-blind trials testing the effectiveness of existing antiandrogens in ameliorating flare responses. RESULTS: The use of LHRH analogs for patients with stage D2 disease can be associated with clinical flare in approximately 10% of D2 patients. In addition to bone pain, cord compression, and bladder outlet obstruction, another potentially severe side effect is cardiovascular risk arising presumably from hypercoagulability associated with a rapid increase in tumor burden. In clinical series involving D2 patients, the frequency of clinical flare greatly varies, probably because of the level of scrutiny of the investigator and/or the prostate-cancer tumor burden present at the initiation of therapy. Concomitant antiandrogen therapy reduces, but does not totally eliminate, the flare responses in patients at high risk for flare. Treating prostate cancer in the D0 stage or in the neoadjuvant setting will result in biochemical evidence of testosterone surge, but these patients are at very little risk for clinical flare responses. CONCLUSIONS: There is a wide variation in the reported frequency of clinical flare responses from LHRH analogs during the initial treatment of patients with stage D2 disease. The risk-to-benefit ratio, especially in patients with symptomatic bone metastasis, would dictate routine use of antiandrogen therapy for the first month of LHRH analog treatment. For patients at risk for cord compression, other means of ablating testosterone might be considered, such as ketoconazole, orchiectomy, or LHRH antagonists. Clinical flare responses, as opposed to biochemical flare responses, are very rare during LHRH analog therapy for stage D0 disease and/or in the setting of neoadjuvant hormonal therapy","","","","","","S0090429501012353 [pii]","Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts, USA. gbubley@caregroup.harvard.edu","PM:11502435","","","",""

In this study, we examined the correlation of the injected activity and the whole-body absorbed dose with treatment toxicity and response. Since the best response is likely to be related to the maximum possible injected activity limited by the whole-body absorbed dose, the relationship between pre-therapy biochemical and physiological parameters and the whole-body absorbed dose was studied to derive an algorithm to predict the whole-body absorbed dose prior to injection of the radionuclide. The whole-body retention of radioactivity was measured at several time points after injection in a cohort of patients receiving activities ranging between 2,468 MBq and 5,497 MBq. The whole-body absorbed dose was calculated by fitting a sequential series of exponential phases to the whole-body time-activity data and by integrating this fit over time to obtain the whole-body cumulated activity. This was then converted to absorbed dose using the Medical Internal Radiation Dose (MIRD) committee methodology. Treatment toxicity was estimated by the relative decrease in white cell (WC) and platelet (Plt) counts after the injection of the radionuclide, and by their absolute nadir values. The criterion for a treatment response was a 50% or greater decrease in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) value lasting for 4 weeks. Alkaline phosphatase (AlkPh), chromium-51 ethylene diamine tetra-acetate ((51)Cr-EDTA) clearance rate and weight were measured before injection of the radionuclide. The whole-body absorbed dose showed a significant correlation with WC and Plt toxicity ( P=0.005 and 0.003 for the relative decrease and P=0.006 and 0.003 for the nadir values of WC and Plt counts respectively) in a multivariate analysis which included injected activity, whole-body absorbed dose, pre-treatment WC and Plt baseline counts, PSA and AlkPh values, and the pre-treatment Soloway score. The injected activity did not show any correlation with WC or Plt toxicity, but it did correlate with PSA response ( P=0.005). These results suggest that the administration of higher activities would be likely to generate a better response, but that the quantity of activity that can be administered is limited by the whole-body absorbed dose. We have derived and evaluated a model that estimates the whole-body absorbed dose on an individual patient basis prior to injection. This model uses the level of injected activity and pre-injection measurements of AlkPh, weight and (51)Cr-EDTA clearance. It gave good estimates of the whole-body absorbed dose, with an average difference between predicted and measured values of 15%. Furthermore, the whole-body absorbed dose predicted using this algorithm correlated with treatment toxicity. It could therefore be used to administer levels of activity on a patient-specific basis, which would help in the optimisation of targeted radionuclide therapy. We believe that algorithms of this kind, which use pre-injection biochemical and physiological measurements, could assist in the design of escalation trials based on a toxicity-limiting whole-body absorbed dose, rather than using the more conventional activity escalation approach","","","","","","10.1007/s00259-003-1197-y [doi]","Institute of Cancer Research, London, UK. buffa@gci.ac.uk","PM:12761596","","","",""

This mandates development of new therapies such as immunotherapy. In this Phase 2 trial, we determined the efficacy of antigen presenting cells (APCs) loaded with PA2024, a recombinant fusion protein containing prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) and GM-CSF. METHODS: We enrolled 21 patients with histologically documented androgen-independent prostate carcinoma that could be evaluated by radionuclide bone scan or computed tomography scan. APC8015 was prepared from a leukapheresis product; it contained autologous CD54-positive PA2024-loaded APCs with admixtures of monocytes, macrophages, B and T cells. APC8015 was infused intravenously twice, 2 weeks apart. Two weeks after the second infusion, patients received three subcutaneous injections of 1.0 mg of PA2024 1 month apart. We monitored patients' physical condition, immune response, and laboratory parameters. RESULTS: Nineteen patients could be evaluated for response to treatment. The median time to progression was 118 days. Treatment was tolerated reasonably well; most adverse effects were secondary to APC8015 and were NCI Common Toxicity Criteria Grade 1-2. Four of the 21 patients reported Grade 3-4 adverse events. Two patients exhibited a transient 25-50% decrease in prostate-specific antigen (PSA). For a third patient, PSA dropped from 221 ng/ml at baseline to undetectable levels by week 24 and has remained so for more than 4 years. In addition, this patient's metastatic retroperitoneal and pelvic adenopathy has resolved. PBMC collected from patients for at least 16 weeks proliferated upon in vitro stimulation by PA2024. For the patient with responsive disease, PBMC could be stimulated for 96 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates a definite clinical response of androgen-independent prostate cancer to APC immunotherapy. Currently we are studying this mode of therapy in Phase 3 trials","","","","","","10.1002/pros.20040 [doi]","Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota 55902, USA","PM:15176049","","","",""

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-two patients underwent 59 vertebroplasty procedures for 103 painful vertebral metastases, among which 53 were pure osteoblastic and 50 were mixed (blastic and lytic). Analgesic efficacy was classified as 'excellent,' 'good,' 'fair,' and 'poor.' The patients were followed up at 1 month, 6 months, 12 months, 2 years, and 5 years. The mean follow-up period was 17 months. RESULTS: The analgesic efficacy rate was 86% at 1 month and 92% at 6 months (among which 71% of patients had 'excellent' results and 21% had with 'good' results). In most cases, it was stable. It was correlated with vertebral filling quality (Fisher test, P = .0932 at 1 month follow-up) but neither with filling volume (Mann-Whitney test, P = .143 at 1 month) nor with the vertebral structure, pure blastic or mixed (Fisher test, P = .784 at 1 month). There were 5 filling failures (4.7%) whose occurrence was correlated with the pure blastic structure of the vertebra (Mann-Whitney test, P = .033). Local clinical complications were observed in 5 cases (8.5%): 1 transitory radiculalgia (1.7%), 2 durable radiculalgias (3.4%), 1 cauda equina syndrome (1.7%), and 1 hemothorax (1.7%). General clinical complications were 2 pulmonary embolisms (3.4%). No patients died. The occurrence of clinical complications was not correlated with the vertebral structure (Fisher test, P = .279).

As concerns early events, much interest is being paid to modifications in the expression of GSTP1 and NKX3.1 occurring in totipotent stem cell populations. The discovery of fusion genes implicating TMPRSS2 and ERG (and, on rare occasions, other ETS family transcription factors) constitutes a major advance. Under physiological androgenic stimulation, the presence of these fusion genes leads to overexpression of genes involved in cell growth and differentiation. Concomitantly, alterations in numerous signalling pathways (growth factors, Wnt-beta catenine, PI3K/Akt) are responsible for the onset of an aggressive tumor phenotype. Hormono-independence is currently explained by an amplification of, or mutations in, androgenic receptors. These are facilitated by genomic instabilities linked to alterations in proteins which regulate gene expression, such as EZH2, and by the influence of the tumor microenvironment. Disturbances in the interactions between tumor cells and the microenvironment contribute to local extension of the tumor. Changes in the expression of E-cadherin are responsible for modifications in cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix. The expression of metalloproteases and of angiogenic factors favors tumor dissemination. Finally, the bone tropism in prostate metastases is probably linked to osteomimetic properties of prostate tumor cells which are capable of expressing certain proteins involved in bone remodelling, such as Runx-2, BSP (bone sialoprotein) and BMP (bone morphogenetic protein). Numerous studies remain to be carried out in order to correlate the identified genetic profiles and molecular anomalies with tumor prognosis. Nevertheless, the possibility of decrypting these anomalies for use in therapeutic applications is encouraging","","","","","","","Laboratoire d'anatomie et cytologie pathologiques, Hopital d'Instruction des Armees Val-de-Grace, 74 boulevard de Port-Royal, 75005 Paris. phcamparo@yahoo.fr","PM:17845997","","","",""

Two hundred eighty-eight asymptomatic patients with HRPCa and evidence of metastatic disease were randomly assigned to one of three study groups receiving a once-daily oral dose of placebo, 2.5 mg atrasentan, or 10 mg atrasentan, respectively.

Endothelins (ETs) and their receptors have emerged as a potential target in prostate cancer bone metastasis. By activating the ETA receptor, ET-1 is pathogenically involved in facilitating several aspects of prostate cancer progression, including proliferation, escape from apoptosis, invasion, and new bone formation, processes that are general to many malignancies. Notwithstanding, there are a number of features specifically driven by the ET axis in prostate cancer, such as creating and perpetuating a unique interaction between the metastatic prostate cancer cell and the bone microenvironment (osteoblast, osteoclast, and stroma) or altering the equilibrium in pain modulation. These features have led to the preferential clinical evaluation of atrasentan (ABT-627) as a biological therapy in prostate carcinoma, first in hormone-refractory prostate cancer. Biological activity of atrasentan in patients with prostate cancer has been shown by the suppression of biochemical markers of prostate cancer progression in bone, and clinical activity is evidenced by a consistent trend demonstrating a delay in time to disease progression when compared with placebo, especially in patients with bone metastases. Further studies of atrasentan and other selective ET-1 antagonists (ZD4054) are ongoing","","","","","","12/20/6296s [pii];10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-06-0929 [doi]","Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, Baltimore, Maryland 21231-1000, USA. carducci@jhmi.edu","PM:17062717","","","",""

METHODS: This multinational, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial enrolled 809 men with metastatic HRPC. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either atrasentan 10 mg per day or placebo. The primary endpoint was time to disease progression (TTP), which was determined according to radiographic and clinical measures. Analyses of overall survival and changes in biomarkers also were performed. RESULTS: Atrasentan did not reduce the risk of disease progression relative to placebo (hazards ratio, 0.89; 95% confidence interval, 0.76-1.04; P = .136). Most patients progressed radiographically at the first 12-week bone scan without concomitant clinical progression. In exploratory analyses, increases from baseline to final bone alkaline phosphatase (BAP) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels were significantly lower with atrasentan treatment (P < .05 for each). The median time to BAP progression (>/=50% increase from nadir) was twice as long with atrasentan treatment (505 days vs 254 days; P < .01). The delay in time to PSA progression did not reach statistical significance. Atrasentan generally was tolerated well, and the most common adverse events associated with treatment were headache, rhinitis, and peripheral edema, reflecting the vasodilatory and fluid-retention properties of endothelin-A receptor antagonism. CONCLUSIONS: Atrasentan did not delay disease progression in men with metastatic HRPC despite evidence of biologic effects on PSA and BAP as markers of disease burden","","","","","","10.1002/cncr.22996 [doi]","Prostate Cancer Program, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, Baltimore, Maryland, USA. carducci@jhmi.edu","PM:17886253","","","",""

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients received vinorelbine (i.v. 25 mg/m2) on days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks and estramustine (oral, 600 mg/m2) daily. Eligible patients were required to have progressive metastatic disease following the first hormonal manipulation. RESULTS: Of the 51 patients enrolled (median age = 69 years), 84% presented bone involvement and 75% had at least two organs involved at the time of study entry and 47 were evaluable for treatment efficacy. Prostate specific antigen (PSA) response (> or =50% decrease) which was the primary efficacy criterion was reported in 21 patients (41.2%) in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population and in 20 patients (48.8%) in the per protocol (PP) population. Of the 7 patients with measurable disease, 2 achieved partial response. Median progression-free survival and overall survival were 4.7 months (range: 1.9-8.6) and 14.3 months (range: 4.2-21.2), respectively. Grade 3-4 neutropenia was reported in 6.1% of patients and in 1% of cycles. The incidence of complicated neutropenia (febrile neutropenia reported in 1 patient and septic shock with severe neutropenia reported in 2 patients) was 5.8%. The most frequent grade 3-4 non-haematological events (% of patients > or =5%) included anorexia (10%), thrombosis/embolism (8%), vomiting and hypotension (6% each). There were 3 toxic deaths (5.9 %) resulting from pulmonary embolism, angina pectoris, and septic shock. The impact of combined chemotherapy on the quality-of-life (QL) of the patients was assessed between baseline and the first evaluation scheduled at 6 weeks indicated a marked reduction in pain while the rest of the symptoms remained stable. Overall, health status improved slightly over the treatment period. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed that the combination of vinorelbine and estramustine is an active regimen in patients with hormone-resistant prostate cancer who had not been treated previously with chemotherapy. Main toxicities included complicated neutropenia even though the incidence of severe neutropenia was low. We observed a higher incidence of toxic deaths which could have been related to the regimen of estramustine used in the study","","","","","","13074213 [pii]","Oncology Unit, Hospital del Mar, 08003 Barcelona, Spain. jcarles@imas.imim.es","PM:15899211","","","",""

In the EPC programme, bicalutamide 150 mg/day, as an adjunct to radiotherapy, radical prostatectomy or watchful waiting, significantly reduced the risk of objective disease progression, the incidence of bone metastases and the risk of prostate specific antigen progression compared with placebo (p < 0.0001 for all three parameters) after a median follow-up of 3 years. Survival data are currently immature, with an overall mortality rate of 6% in both treatment arms. On two nonblind, randomised trials, bicalutamide 150 mg/day monotherapy was as effective as medical or surgical castration in terms of overall survival in patients with locally advanced nonmetastatic prostate cancer. After a median follow-up of 6.3 years, median survival was 63.5 and 69.9 months for bicalutamide and castration, respectively; time to disease progression was also similar between treatment groups.

This study assessed the cost effectiveness of ZOL for SRE management in French, German, Portuguese, and Dutch HRPC patients. Methods: This analysis was based on the results of a randomized phase III clinical trial wherein HRPC patients received up to 15 months of ZOL (n = 214) or placebo (n = 208). Clinical inputs were obtained from the trial. Costs were estimated using hospital tariffs, published, and internet sources. Quality adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained were estimated from a separate analysis of EQ-5D scores reported in the trial. Uncertainty surrounding outcomes was addressed via univariate sensitivity analyses. Results: ZOL patients experienced an estimated 0.759 fewer SREs and gained an estimated 0.03566 QALYs versus placebo patients. ZOL was associated with reduced SRE-related costs [net costs] (-euro2396 [euro1284] in France, -euro2606 [euro841] in Germany, -euro3326 [euro309] in Portugal and -euro3617 [euro87] in the Netherlands). Costs per QALY ranged from euro2430 (Netherlands) to euro36,007 (France). Conclusions: This analysis is subject to the limitations of most cost-effectiveness analyses: it combines data from multiple sources. Nevertheless, the results strongly suggest that ZOL is cost effective versus placebo in French, German, Portuguese, and Dutch HRPC patients","","","","","","10.3111/13696998.2011.570170 [doi]","Pharmerit International, Health Economics , Bethesda, MD , USA","PM:21469915","","","",""

We investigated the capability of stereotactic body radiotherapy to treat limited nodal recurrences, detected using choline PET scan. METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: Seventy-one patients with biochemical failure were studied after prostate cancer treatment: prostatectomy (28), radiotherapy (15) or both (28). Following computed tomography and choline PET imaging, stereotactic body radiotherapy was delivered on pathological lymphatic areas by 6 MV Linac, using dynamic micromultileaf collimation and intensity-modulated arc therapy optimization. Sixty days post-treatment, choline PET/CT imaging was carried out. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 29 months (range, 14.4-48). Choline PET detected recurrences in 39 of 71 patients. Median PSA velocity was 0.40 ng/ml/year in PET-negative patients and 2.88 ng/ml/year in PET-positive subjects (P < 0.05). Twenty-five patients with limited nodal recurrences, out of the 71 submitted to choline PET, received eradicative radiotherapy. Persistent regression was recorded in 13; early spread to bone was found in 2 cases; lymph node recurrences in 8, all in sites outside the irradiated areas; 2 patients were lost to follow-up. At the 3-year follow-up, overall survival, disease-free survival and local control rates were 92%, 17% and 90%, respectively. In patients with a complete regression, PSA fell from 5.65 to 1.40 ng/ml (median). PSA nadir value (median 1.06 ng/ml) was maintained for 5.6 months (median). CONCLUSIONS: Stereotactic body radiotherapy was effective in disease eradication of limited nodal recurrences from prostate cancer, saving patients from, or at least postponing, systemic treatments","","","","","","","Clinical Radiobiological Institute, University of Firenze, Italy. f.casamassima@dfc.unifi.it","PM:21528664","","","",""

However, the median duration of response to androgen deprivation therapy is only 18-24 months for patients with metastatic disease. Chemotherapy was historically viewed as ineffective in this disease, and clinical trials of chemotherapy conducted during 1970 and 1980 demonstrated limited benefit in patients with castrate-resistant advanced prostate cancer. In the late 1990s two randomized trials demonstrated for the first time that chemotherapy based on mitoxantrone plus cor ticosteroids provided a clinical benefit to patients with castrate-resistant advanced prostate cancer. In 2004 two important phase III clinical trials demonstrated a clinically significant survival advantage with docetaxel-based chemotherapy, which firmly established this regimen - docetaxel plus prednisone - as the standard of care in castrate-resistant advanced prostate cancer. However, assuming that the prognosis of men with castrate-resistant advanced prostate cancer remains poor, we need to improve the treatment of this disease, building upon the success of docetaxel by combining this age nt with both chemotherapy and with the many novel biological agents developed, as our understanding of the molecular basis of the prostate cancer has taken place","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: We evaluated 102 consecutive patients (mean age = 68 years, range = 54-82 years) previously treated with RP and who presented during FU a mild increase of trigger PSA serum levels <1.5 ng/ml: mean 0.86 +/- 0.40 ng/ml (range 0.2-1.5) and median 0 .93 ng/ml (range 0.67-1.10). In this patient series SUP 11 C-choline PET/CT was used as the first imaging examination at the time of the detection of a mild serum PSA increase <1.5 ng/ml. SUP 11 C-Choline PET/CT was performed following standard procedures in our centre. At the time of PET/CT, 86 patients were not receiving any pharmacologic treatment, while 16 were under anti-androgenic therapy. Positive PET findings were validated by: (a) transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided biopsy in cases of local recurrence, (b) surgical lymphadenectomy, (c) other imaging procedures or (d) FU lasting for at least 12 months. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to evaluate the following variables: age, TNM staging, Gleason score, time from RP to the biochemical relapse, anti-androgen therapy at the time of SUP 11 C -choline PET/CT scan, trigger PSA value and PSA kinetics, i.e. PSA doubling time (PSAdt) and PSA velocity (PSAvel), in order to assess the significant predictive factors related to the findings of a positive SUP 11 C-choline PET/CT scan. Results: Overall, SUP 11 C-choline PET/CT showed positive findings in 29 of 102 patients (28% of cases). In detail, SUP 11 C-choline PET/CT detected: local relapse in 7 patients, bone metastases in 13 patients (4 single and 9 multiple) and lymph node metastases in 9 patients (6 single and 3 multiple). Positive PET findings were validated by: (a) TRUS-guided bi opsy in 7 patients with local recurrence, (b) surgery and lymphadenectomy in 3 patients, (c) other targeted imaging procedures (MR or bone scan) in 5 patients and (d) clinical FU lasting a minimum of 12 months and including also a contrast-enhanced CT (CECT), an MR, a bone scan and a repeated SUP 11 C-choline PET/CT in 14 patients. Age, time to biochemical relapse (TTR), initial T staging, Gleason score and trigger PSA were not statistically significant in predicting a positive SUP 11 C-choline PET/CT scan both at univariate and multivariate analysis. Instead, PSA kinetics (PSAdt and PSAvel), N status and anti-androgenic therapy at the time of PET scan were statistically significant predictive factors at univariate analysis. Of note, only PSAdt and initial N status were found to be significant and independent predictive factors at multivariate analysis. The mean PSAdt in PET-positive patients was 4.34 months (SD 2.82) while in PET-negative patients it was 13.30 months (SD 9.75) (p = 0.0001). The optimal threshold for PSAdt established by receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was 7.25 months (AUC 0.85; 95% confidence interval 0.77-0.91) providing 93% sensitivity, 74% spec ificity, 60% positive predictive value and 96% negative predictive value. Conclusion: In our study, SUP 11 C-choline PET/CT was able to detect recurrent disease in 28% of the patients with mild biochemical relapse characterized by very low trigger PSA levels (PSA <1.5 ng/ml). Very interestingly SUP 11 C-choline PET/CT detected distant unexpected metastases in 21% of the patients. At multivariate statistical analysis only PSAdt and node status were shown to be significant and independent predictive factors for positive SUP 11 C-choline PET/CT. Therefore, SUP 11 C-choline could be suggested to be performed early during initial biochemical relapse in patients presenting with fast PSA kinetics. The early detection of the site of recurrence could lead to a prompt instauration of the most appropriate treatment, i.e. local surgery or radiation treatment vs systemic treatment. In this view, one of the main advantages should be the avoidance of unnecessary local radiotherapy in those patients showing distant metastasis at SUP 11 C-choline PET/CT.

Follow-up duties may be reasonably shared between the oncologist and the family doctor or urologist; however, it is probable that some follow-up information specific to the irradiated patient will be lost unless the oncologist maintains regular contact with the patient, especially in the first 5 years of follow-up when late radiation effects are most likely to appear. There is no strong evidence that patients stop being at risk for recurrence at any time after treatment, and because PSA testing is an accurate, simple, and inexpensive method of determining post-RT tumor status, it is recommended that periodic PSA measurements be continued for life. In the absence of a rising PSA, all other tests and visits are unnecessary to determine post-RT tumor control. Because DRE has been shown to be of limited utility in follow-up of irradiated patients, it should be possible to effectively follow patients remotely. This could be done by asking patients to have PSA tests done, forward the results to their physicians, and report treatment toxicity when it occurs. Only abnormal results would trigger an office visit. This strategy is being evaluated in clinical trials. The alternative is to delegate the follow-up to the primary-care physician with guidelines as to when referral back is required. Fol low-up frequency, and the most beneficial follow-up investigations vary from scenario to scenario, and are influenced by the likelihood of relapse, time to relapse, and planned intervention. These decisions are influenced in turn by the initial presentation-either with high or low risk factors-and by the patient's general state of health at completion of EBRT. Effective follow-up also requires active patient cooperation that only can be achieved after discussion of the goals of follow-up with the patient and with the patient's full understanding of the process. The follow-up strategy proposed in Fig. 1 is most suitable for a fit patient with low or intermediate risk factors who wishes to consider all salvage options should he relapse, or for the high-risk individual in situations in which the probability of system ic relapse is of major concern. Young patients with very adverse risk factors may benefit from even closer follow-up in the early years after EBRT and the elderly or frail may require only occasional visits to record or treat treatment toxicity and to ensure clinical nonprogression","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Bone metastasis is found in 65 to 75% of advanced prostate cancer patients. This tumoral burden is a significant cause of complications, morbidity and lower quality of life. The treatment of metastatic bone disease requires a multidisciplinary approach that addresses indolent and painful bone metastasis. Indolent bone metastasis necessitates a combination of hormonal therapy, chemotherapy and bisphosphonate therapy (zoledronic acid). Painful bone metastasis requires a multi-modal approach, including a combination of hormonal therapy, che motherapy, bisphosphonate therapy, analgesics, and, if needed, radiotherapy, radionuclides and orthopaedic surgery.

The effects of new HRPC therapies on patients' QOL need to be studied. Patient-based assessments that help quantify the risk-benefit profile of HRPC therapies are warranted. This review summarizes the known QOL literature and estimates the potential effect of atrasentan, a novel, selective endothelin A receptor antagonist (SERA), on the QOL of HRPC patients. Methods: Published studies were identified through a s tructured, detailed literature review. Clinical studies that report QOL data were reviewed, along with recent QOL data from atrasentan studies. Results: HRPC studies have begun to use QOL assessments as primary endpoints, but different assessments and therapies are not comparable. Very few data integrate QOL with clinical endpoints. Atrasentan clinical trials demonstrated a statistically significant difference in the prostate cancer-specific QOL in favor of atrasentan (p = .032) and an increased quality-adjusted time to progression in men with HRPC. Conclusions: Atrasentan provides QOL benefits relevant to HRPC. The quality-adjusted analyses applied in the atrasentan studies have begun to lay the foundation for interpreting clinical endpoints in conjunction with QOL. These analyses will facilitate better QOL comparisons within studies and across trials. Further evaluation of atrasentan in HRPC is warranted. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

METHODS: We obtained data from a Phase III trial of atrasentan in metastatic hormone-refractory prostate cancer patients (n = 809). We determined anchor-based differences using Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS), bone alkaline phosphatase (BAP), hemoglobin, time to disease progression (TTP), adverse events (AE), and survival. One-third and one-half standard deviation and standard error of measurement (SEM) were used as distribution-based criteria for CMCs. Comparison across baseline FACT-P domains and derived scales [FACT-P total score, Trial Outcome Index (TOI) score, prostate cancer subscale (PCS) score, pain-related score, and FACT Advanced Prostate Symptom Index (FAPSI)] were conducted for KPS, BAP, and hemoglobin using Student's t tests. Twelve-week change scores were compared for TTP, AE, and survival using ANCOVA. RESULTS: CMCs were estimated as 6 to 10 for FACT-P total score, 5 to 9 for FACT-P TOI score, 2 to 3 for FACT-P PCS, 1 to 2 for the 4 PCS pain-related questions, and 2 to 3 for FAPSI. CMCs were also estimated using distribution-based criteria. Kappa statistics were computed to determine the degree of correspondence between the recommended guideline of 1.0 SEM and empirically derived standards. Most of the kappas for health-related quality of life domains and SEM standards had 'substantial' to 'almost perfect' concordance. CONCLUSIONS: The significant relationship between clinical and quality of life data provides support for the use of CMCs to increase interpretability of FACT-P scores","","","","","","VHE409 [pii];10.1111/j.1524-4733.2008.00409.x [doi]","Center on Outcomes, Research and Education (CORE), Evanston Northwestern Healthcare, Evanston, IL, USA","PM:18647260","","","",""

The clinical files of 634 patients with prostate cancer seen in a comprehensive cancer center during a 4-year period were retrospectively reviewed. One hundred nineteen patients (18.8%) had 212 significant episodes of osseous spinal metastases. Pain was nearly universal (93%), and motor and bladder impairment occurred in 25% and 3.1% of patients, respectively. Bone scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed in 197 and 64 episodes, respectively. Fifteen episodes of spinal cord compression were treated surgically. Other treatments included hormonal therapy (163 episodes), chemotherapy (70 episodes), and radiation therapy (103 episodes). Osteolytic lesions were observed alone and in combination with osteoblastic pattern in 18% and 26% of episodes, respectively. Bone scan was the most effective screening procedure of vertebral involvement, and MRI effectively showed epidural involvement. Overall treatment led to improvements in pain and motor impairment in 77% and 50% of patients, respectively. However, clinical episodes were recurrent (1.78 episodes per patient; range, 1-8). Median survival after vertebral metastasis episode was 14 months compared with only 4 months after surgery for spinal cord compression. Vertebral metastases strongly alter quality of life in patients with prostate cancer. Pain and neurologic complications are the major problems. Careful early screening with bone scan and MRI may help to define better treatment strategy. However, further prospective studies of clinical management are needed to determine the optimal timing of radiation therapy, medical treatments, and surgery","","","","","","","Oncology Service, Hospital de La Fuerza Aerea de Chile, Santiago, Chile","PM:15046682","","","",""

Preclinical evidence supports the role of estrogen receptor signaling in prostate cancer. In this trial we investigated the tolerability and efficacy of fulvestrant, a pure estrogen receptor antagonist, in the treatment of castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). METHODS. Patients with CRPC were enrolled after written informed consent. Fulvestrant was administered by intramuscular injection at a dose of 500 mg on day 0, then 250 mg on day 14, day 28 and monthly thereafter. History, physical examination, serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels and toxicity was evaluated monthly. Radiographic studies were repeated every 3 months to assess disease. Treatment was continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, non-compliance or consent withdrawal. RESULTS. Twenty patients were enrolled over a period of six months. All patients were Caucasians with median age of 69.5 years [range: 47-85 years]. Sixteen patients (80%) had radiological evidence of metastasis and four patients (20%) had rising PSA as the only evidence of progressive disease. Patients received a median of three treatment cycles of fulvestrant [range: 1-11]. Median time to progression was 4.3 months (95% confidence interval of 3-5.7 months) and median overall survival was 19.4 months (range: 9.9-19.4 months) after a median follow-up of 16 months. No patient showed >=50% reduction in PSA or radiologic improvement. Few adverse events were noted, none of which were attributed directly to fulvestrant. CONCLUSION. Fulvestrant was well tolerated but failed to produce clinical or PSA response in men with CRPC. (c) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: Thirty-two patients (median age 70 years) with clinically localized, moderately differentiated (Gleason 6/10) prostate cancer treated by external beam radiotherapy alone (68.4 Gy) with available paraffin blocks at the Massachusetts General Hospital were evaluated for this pilot study. All patients had clinical Stage M0 disease at initial presentation, which was documented by bone scan (T1c-4,NX). Their corresponding biopsy specimens were stained immunohistochemically for Tbeta15, which was then correlated with the clinical outcome in a blinded manner. The median follow-up was 6 years (range 1 to 19) for all of the patients. RESULTS: The outcomes of the 32 patients can be grouped into three categories: patients with no evidence of disease (n = 11), patients with PSA failure without documented bone failure (n = 11), and patients with PSA failure and documented bone failure (n = 10). Tbeta15 staining intensity strongly correlated with clinical outcome. Of those patients whose specimens stained 3+ (strongest staining), 62% developed bone failure compared with 13% of those patients whose specimens stained 1+ (weakest staining) (P = 0.01). The 5-year freedom from PSA failure was only 25% for those patients with 3+ staining compared with 83% for those with 1+ staining (P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this pilot study have demonstrated that Tbeta15 staining intensity may be a potentially important marker to identify high-risk patients with moderately differentiated, clinically localized prostate cancer","","","","","","S0090-4295(00)00462-3 [pii]","Department of Radiation Oncology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02114, USA","PM:10792068","","","",""

Androgen deprivation increases bone resorption, thereby leading to a more rapid decrease of bone mineral density (BMD) at multiple skeletal sites as compared with age-matched healthy men. ADT has been associated with an increased risk of skeletal fracture in several retrospective analyses. The role of androgens in maintaining bone health appears to be mediated indirectly through their conversion to estrogens, although testosterone may be an important factor in bone formation. Physicians need to be aware of the potential for osteoporosis and should inform patients of appropriate lifestyle and diet modifications, such as calcium and vitamin D supplementation, and exercise at the initiation of ADT. Evaluating BMD may become the accepted norm. Several studies suggest that bisphosphonates may be beneficial in preventing and treating osteoporosis in patients with prostate cancer. The overall benefit of ADT in men with prostate cancer will continue to improve as potential side effects, such as osteoporosis, are recognized and addressed successfully.

Despite much research, to the authors' knowledge few studies published to date have provided definitive treatment answers. The Society of Urologic Oncology (SUO) convened a multidisciplinary panel of urologists, oncologists, and radiation oncologists to develop a treatment algorithm for patients with hormone-refractory prostate carcinoma. The resulting treatment outline was based on a review of the literature review and on the expert opinions of the panelists. The current article provided a logical progression of treatment choices that included hormonal manipulations, chemotherapeutic options, and adjunctive therapies. Future clinical trials and therapies were also discussed by the authors. Management strategies should be targeted toward the individual patient. Although significant progress has been made in understanding and treating hormone-refractory prostate carcinoma, earlier interventions would be ideal and better therapeutic approaches to prolong survival are necessary.

We discuss the implications of our findings. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An analysis was performed of a prospectively organised data base of 1118 patients treated at our institution by radical prostatectomy after the introduction of PSA in 1987. A strict definition of PSA progression was used, that is any elevation above undetectable PSA or lowest recorded post-operative PSA (nadir), in order not to miss a single patient who may have recurrent local disease or distant metastases without PSA progression. We counted local recurrent disease as those patients having histologically proven adenocarcinoma on TRUS directed biopsies, and distant disease as those patients having detectable metastatic disease on radionuclide bone scan. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 4.0 years (3 months to 15 years). 524 men (46.9%) had a follow-up of more than 5 years and 88 men (7.9%) of more than 10 years. A total of 397 men (35.5%) had biochemical progression according to our strict definition. 53 patients (4.7%) developed a histological local recurrence and 57 men (5.1%) developed bony metastases; none of these men had an undetectable PSA or a stable PSA at nadir level at the time of detection. They all demonstrated a rising PSA. CONCLUSIONS: DRE is no longer necessary in the routine follow-up of patients with an undetectable PSA after radical prostatectomy. Following a period of approximately 2 years of out-patient clinic follow-up post-operatively in which issues such as incontinence and erectile dysfunction are addressed and treated, it is possible to restrict follow-up to PSA determinations alone and as long as the PSA remains undetectable counselling can be carried out by a nurse practitioner","","","","","","S0302-2838(05)00441-0 [pii];10.1016/j.eururo.2005.07.006 [doi]","Department of Urology, CA Rotterdam, Netherlands. b.chaplin@erasmusmc.nl","PM:16126322","","","",""

Targeted therapies against receptor tyrosine kinases of the ErbB family have shown some promise in the treatment of HRPC; however, patient characteristics defining susceptibility to ErbB-targeted therapies remain unknown in HRPC and limits their efficacy in the clinic. Targeted inhibition of downstream pathways, namely mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) may prove to be important in the treatment of HRPC because of the prevalence of phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) loss, and it has been shown preclinically that mTOR inhibition reverses the phenotype of PTEN loss. Further investigation is necessary for the targeted inhibition of receptor tyrosine kinases and mTOR in HRPC. However, these classes of drugs may prove efficacious as tumoricidal agents or as chemo- and radiosensitizers. (c) 2008 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Patients and methods: Between 1980 and 1994, 96 patients with prostate cancer and bony metastasis were included for an evaluation by a retrospective review of their charts. All 96 had received hormonal treatment after a diagnosis of metastatic prostatic carcinoma. Serum testosterone, luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and prolactin were assessed before treatment. The patients were divided into two groups according to their response during the follow-up. Group 1 (good response) had no change or resolution of metastatic lesion(s) on the bone scan and a declining prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level. Group 2 had increased PSA or progression of metastatic lesion(s) on the bone scan. Tumours were graded as low (2-4), intermediate (5-7) and high (8-10) using the Gleason score. Results: There were 43 patients in group 1 and 53 in group 2; the overall mean (SD) age was 72.5 (6.8) years and the follow-up 29.5 (0.5) months. The respective mean (SD) levels of testosterone, LH, FSH and prolactin before treatment were 4.6 (1.6) ng/mL, 20.2 (13.3) mIU/mL, 19.6 (18.6) mIU/mL and 20.7 (12.1) ng/mL in group 1, and 2.6 (1.0) ng/mL, 27.3 (11.0) mIU/mL, 27.1 (9.8) mIU/mL and 41.3 (28.4) ng/mL in group 2. The level of testosterone was significantly higher in group 1 than in group 2, while LH, FSH and prolactin were significantly lower in group 1 than in group 2. When stratified by tumour grade, patients in group 1 still had significantly higher pretreatment testosterone and lower LH, FSH and prolactin than those in group 2. Conclusion: Higher testosterone and lower LH, FSH and prolactin levels were good prognostic factors for patients with metastatic prostatic cancer under hormonal treatment, irrespective of tumour grading","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The prognosis and proper treatment of stage T1a prostate cancer remain unsettled. The aim of the study was to identify retrospectively some predictors of disease progression in stage T1a prostate cancer. Methods. We reported on 52 patients with stage T1a prostate cancer diagnosed between 1983 and 1996 at Taichung Veterans General Hospital. The recorded clinical follow-up, pathological staging and treatment of these patients were reviewed. Disease progression is defined as progressive elevation of the serum PSA value and proved by transrectal needle biopsy of the prostate or the app earance of metastatic disease. All original surgical pathology material from each patient was reviewed by a single pathologist and graded by the Gleason system. Results. The mean age of patients with T1a prostate cancer at diagnosis was 71.5 +/- 7 years old. During the median follow-up of 7.3 years (range, 0.5 to 15 years), four patients (7.7%) developed disease progression. Twenty-one patients died due to other causes and no patient died due to prostate cancer. It was statistically significant that the patient with pathological Gleason score >= 5 had positive correlation with disease progression. Conclusions. The clinical course of stage T1a prostate cancer is va riable. The presence of Gleason score >= 5 in pathological report is usually associated with cancer progression. More aggressive treatment including radical prostatectomy or local radiotherapy is advised in those selected high risk patients with a long life expectancy. Patients with tumor Gleason score < 5 have a low risk of disease progression and can be managed conservatively; but they should remain under observation indefinitely","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The objective of this study was to examine the clinical and pathologic features of metastatic prostate carcinoma to bone in a large cohort of men, and the associations of these features with outcome. METHODS. Sixty-eight men who underwent surgery for metastatic prostate carcinoma to bone for stabilization of a pathologic fracture or impending fracture were studied. Clinical characteristics included the type of treatment for the primary and metastatic prostate carcinoma, age and serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) at the diagnosis of the metastatic prostate carcinoma, radiographic findings of the metastasis (osteoblastic, osteolytic, or mixed), and the number of metastatic sites at the time of the surgery for the metastasis. Pa thologic features examined included Gleason score of the metastatic prostate carcinoma. Immunohistochemical stains for MIB-1, cytokeratin, PSA, synaptophysin, chromogranin A, serotonin, estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and androgen receptor were performed for all cases. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate cancer-specific survival. The duration of follow-up was defined as the interval from the date of surgery for the metastasis to the date of death or last follow-up. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were fit to assess the features that were associated with death from prostate carcinoma. RESULTS. The average (standard deviation) time from the surgery for the metastasis to death from prostate carcinoma was 1.5 (1.9) years, ranging from 0 days to 10 years, with a median of 1 year. The estimated cancer-specific survival rates at 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years were 54.3%, 28.8%, and 22.9%, respectively. Median cancer-specific survival occurred at 1.1 years. After 4 years of follow-up, there were only seven patients left at risk for death from prostate carcinoma. Features that were found to be significantly associated with death from prostate carcinoma univariately included the interval between the diagnosis of metastasis and the surgery for metastasis (P < 0.001), androgen deprivation therapy before surgery for the metastasis (P = 0.002), presentation with metastasis (P = 0.003), the number of metastatic sites (P = 0.034), Gleason score of the metastasis (P = 0.002), and tumor positivity for chromogranin A (P = 0.041). On multivariate analysis, the interval between the diagnosis of metastasis and the surgery for metastasis (P < 0.001), Gleason score of the metastasis (P < 0.001), and tumor positivity for chromogranin A (P = 0.009) were associated significantly with death from prostate carcinoma. CONCLUSIONS. Although cancer-specific survival for patients after surgery for prostate carcinoma metastatic to bone is poor, assessments of tumor differentiation of the metastasis and chromogranin A positivity provide prognostic information.

The PSA response rate was 3.6% [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.1% to 18.3%] with response occurring in one patient (baseline = 10 000 and nadir = 1643 microg/l). No measurable disease responses occurred in eight patients. Time to PSA progression was 2.3 months (95% CI 1.8-6.4). Of 16 patients who discontinued sorafenib and then did not receive any immediate therapy, 10 had postdiscontinuation PSA declines of 7%-52%. CONCLUSIONS: Sorafenib has limited activity using current PSA criteria. The declines in PSA observed on treatment discontinuation indicate an effect on PSA production/secretion. Further study may be warranted but needs to consider the limitations of PSA as an indicator of progression and response","","","","","","mdm554 [pii];10.1093/annonc/mdm554 [doi]","Department of Medical Oncology, Vancouver Centre, BC Cancer Agency, Vancouver, British Columbia. kchi@bccancer.bc.ca","PM:18056648","","","",""

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive docetaxel/prednisone either with (arm A) or without (arm B) OGX-011 640 mg intravenously weekly. The primary end point was the proportion of patients with a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) decline of >/= 50% from baseline, with the experimental therapy being considered of interest if the proportion of patients with a PSA decline was more than 60%. Secondary end points were objective response rate, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and changes in serum clusterin. RESULTS: Eighty-two patients were accrued, 41 to each arm. OGX-011 adverse effects included rigors and fevers. After cycle 1, median serum clusterin decreased by 26% in arm A and increased by 0.9% in arm B (P < .001). PSA declined by >/= 50% in 58% of patients in arm A and 54% in arm B. Partial response occurred in 19% and 25% of patients in arms A and B, respectively. Median PFS and OS times were 7.3 months (95% CI, 5.3 to 8.8 months) and 23.8 months (95% CI, 16.2 months to not reached), respectively, in arm A and 6.1 months (95% CI, 3.7 to 8.6 months) and 16.9 months (95% CI, 12.8 to 25.8 months), respectively, in arm B. Baseline factors associated with improved OS on exploratory multivariate analysis were an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 (hazard ratio [HR], 0.27; 95% CI, 0.14 to 0.51), presence of bone or lymph node metastases only (HR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.25 to 0.79), and treatment assignment to OGX-011 (HR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.29 to 0.87). CONCLUSION: Treatment with OGX-011 and docetaxel was well tolerated with evidence of biologic effect and was associated with improved survival.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients received weekly paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 by 1-hour intravenous infusion. A course of therapy consisted of 6 weekly treatments and 2 weeks rest. PSA response was defined as a PSA decrease not less than 50%, maintained for 4 weeks with stable or improved performance status. RESULTS: The study enrolled 43 patients with metastatic HRPC diagnosed a median of 10.5 months before. Median age was 69 years (range, 58-86 years). Five had previous radioisotopes treatment for bone pain, 15 had previous treatment of metastatic hormone-refractory disease, mainly estramustine. The median number of weeks of therapy delivered each patient was 8 (range, 1-24 weeks; cumulative, 369 weeks). PSA response was registered in 13 patients of 36 evaluable for PSA response (36.1%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 20.8-53.8), with a median duration of 4.2 months. Among 16 patients evaluable for objective response, 5 partial responses (31.2%; 95% CI, 11.0-58.7) and 9 stable diseases were registered.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This study represents the two largest published surveys of Australian and New Zealand clinicians dealing with prostate cancer. We sent structured questionnaires on the management of prostate cancer patients to 804 urologists, radiation oncologists and medical oncologists in Australia and New Zealand in December 2000. We compared responses to a similar survey of 579 specialist clinicians in 1995. RESULTS: The response rates were 56% in 1995 and 62% in 2000. In the management of clinically localized disease, the proportion recommending surgery or radiotherapy remained relatively constant between 1995 and 2000, although there was an increase in the use of brachytherapy and adjuvant hormonal therapy, and a reduced tendency to treat pelvic nodes. In the treatment of locally advanced disease, there was an increased use of hormonal treatment and local radiotherapy, with a reduction in the use of total androgen blockade and orchidectomy. In managing positive margins after prostatectomy, there was a clear lack of consensus, with a wide variety of treatment options proposed. CONCLUSIONS: Practice has changed in several areas in 2000 compared to 1995, but not all changes were influenced by the publication of randomized trials or evidence-based guidelines","","","","","","BJU6065 [pii];10.1111/j.1464-410X.2006.06065.x [doi]","Collaboration for Cancer Outcomes Research and Evaluation (CCORE), New South Wales, Australia","PM:16542341","","","",""

Although mortality from PCa has been declining over the past decade, metastasis can substantially shorten survival time and remains a major challenge in maintaining quality of life for survivors. PCa cells preferentially metastasize to bone and typically result in osteoblastic lesions. In the late stages of disease, however, osteolytic lesions are observed. The mechanisms of PCa bone metastasis are still unclear, but relationships between the PCa cells and the bone tissue elements are suspected of being more complex than initially thought. Far from being an innocent bystander, the bone participates actively in the metastatic process and provides the cancer cells with growth factors and a fertile environment. Among the various cells in the bone environment, osteoblasts have a central role through their bidirectional interactions with the PCa cells. This review discusses the possible mechanisms of PCa bone metastasis and highlights the essential role of osteoblasts in the metastasis of PCa to bone.

Surveys on the patterns of practice in radiotherapy have been published from North America and Europe. Our objective was to determine the current pattern of practice of radiation oncologists in Canada for the palliation of bone metastases. METHOD: A survey was sent to 300 practicing radiation oncologists in Canada. Five case scenarios were presented. The first three were patients with a single symptomatic site: breast cancer patient with pelvic metastasis, lung cancer male with metastasis to L3 and L1, respectively. The last two were breast and prostate cancer patients with multiple symptomatic bone metastases. RESULTS: A total of 172 questionnaires were returned (57%) for a total of 860 responses. For the three cases with a single painful bone metastasis, over 98% would prescribe radiotherapy. The doses ranged from a single 8 to 30 Gy in ten fractions. Of the 172 respondents, 117 (68%) would use the same dose fractionation for all three cases, suggesting that they had a standard dose fractionation for palliative radiotherapy. The most common dose fractionation was 20 Gy in five fractions used by 84/117 (72%), and 8 Gy in one fraction by 19/117 (16%). In all five case scenarios, 81% would use a short course of radiotherapy (single 8 Gy, 17%; 20 Gy in five fractions, 64%), while 10% would prescribe 30 Gy in ten fractions. For the two cases with diffuse symptomatic bone metastases, half body irradiation (HBI) and radionuclides were recommended more frequently in prostate cancer than in breast cancer (46/172 vs. 4/172, P<0. 0001; and 93/172 vs. 10/172, P<0.0001, respectively). Strontium was the most commonly recommended radionuclide (98/103=95%). Since systemic radionuclides are not readily available in our health care system, 41/98 (42%) of radiation oncologists who would recommend strontium were not familiar with the dose. Bisphosphonates were recommended more frequently in breast cancer than in prostate cancer 13/172 (8%) vs. 1/172 (0.6%), P=0.001. CONCLUSION: Local field external radiotherapy remains the mainstay of therapy, and the most common fractionation for bone metastases in Canada is 20 Gy in five fractions compared with 30 Gy in ten fractions in the US. Despite randomized trials showing similar results for single compared with fractionated radiotherapy, the majority of us still advocate five fractions. The frequency of employing a single fractionation has not changed since the last national survey in 1992. Nearly 70% use a standard dose fractionation to palliate localized painful metastasis by radiotherapy, independent of the site of involvement or tumor type. The pattern of practice of palliative radiotherapy for bone metastases in Canada is different to that reported previously from the US. The reasons why the results of randomized studies on bone metastases have no impact on the patterns of practice are worth exploring","","","","","","S0167-8140(00)00238-3 [pii]","Rapid Response Radiotherapy Program, Toronto-Sunnybrook Regional Cancer Centre, Division of Radiation Oncology, 2075 Bayview Avenue, Ontario, Toronto, Canada M4N 3M5","PM:10974379","","","",""

This review focuses on the published literature that suggests that tumor-microenvironment interaction has a decisive role in controlling local cancer growth, invasion and distant metastasis. As this review shows, genetic alterations in prostate cancer cells alone are not enough to confer metastatic status without a supporting tumor microenvironment. Effective therapeutic targeting requires a deeper understanding of the interplay between tumor and stroma. Approaches co-targeting tumor and stroma already show promise over the conventional targeting of tumor cells alone in preventing prostate cancer progression and eradicating preexisting or newly developed prostate cancers in bone and visceral organs. Materials and Methods: A literature survey using the MEDLINE database was performed in basic and clinical publications relevant to tumor-host microenvironment interaction. Information pertinent to the biology and therapy of prostate cancer local growth and distant metastases was specifically emphasized. Results: Tumor associated stroma actively fuel the progression of prostate cancer from localized growth to the invasion of surrounding tissues, and the development of distant bone and visceral organ metastasis. In concert with this progression tumor cells recovered from metastatic sites could represent a subpopulation of preexisting tumor cells or could be a newly acquired variant subsequent to tumor-stromal interaction. Experimental data from our laboratory and others suggest that permanent genetic and phenotypic changes occur in prostate cancer cells after 3-dimensional co-culture in vitro or when co-inoculated and grown with inductive stromal cells in vivo. These results support the idea that newly acquired variants are the dominant mechanism of prostate cancer progression. Intercellular communication between prostate cancer cells and organ specific stroma, including prostate and marrow stroma, could involve diffusible soluble and solid matrix molecules as mediators, leading to the development of metastasis. This presents a new opportunity for therapeutic targeting for the treatment of benign and malignant growth of the prostate glands. This review summarizes specific research implicating tumor-microenvironment interaction as the molecular basis of cancer progression, providing a rationale for targeting tumor and the tumor associated microenvironment in the management of androgen independent and bone metastatic prostate cancer progression in patients. Conclusions: Cancer is not a single cell disease. Aberrant cancer cells and their interactive microenvironment are needed for prostate cancer to progress to androgen independence and distant metastasis. It is highly plausible that newly evolved prostate cancer cell clones dominate cancer metastasis after cell-cell and cell-matrix interaction with the host microenvironment, rather than the selection or expansion of a preexisting prostate cancer cell clone(s). Based on this premise potential molecular targets in the microenvironment are especially emphasized. Further elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying tumor-stromal interaction may yield improved medical trea tments for prostate cancer growth and metastasis","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With the long natural history of the disease, management of skeletal morbidity related to advanced prostate cancer becomes a major public health issue. The standard of care in advanced prostate cancer is androgen deprivation therapy. This may accelerate the development of osteoporosis and further exacerbate the risks of having adverse skeletal-related events develop. Rescently, the use of bisphosphonates in men who have not responded to androgen deprivation therapy has been shown to reduce the incidence of skeletal-related events with time. Questions remain as to whether bisphosphonates should be broadly applied to earlier stages of the disease or tailored to men at higher risk of having bone-related morbidity Work is ongoing to improve oth er approaches to the medical treatment of bone metastases in patients with advanced prostate cancer including the use of radiopharmaceuticals and combined chemotherapy","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In travenous zoledronic acid (4 mg by 15-min infusion every 3 wk) provided significant benefits compared with placebo, including a reduction in all types of skeletal complications. In addition, zoledronic acid significantly (p < 0.05) decreased bone pain levels compared with placebo at the first on-study pain assessment, and benefits remained significant at the 24-mo time point (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Zoledronic acid provides significant benefit to patients with bone metastases secondary to hormone-refractory prostate cancer. It reduces all types of skeletal-related events, decreases bone pain levels, and may provide additional benefits. (c) 2006 European Associa tion of Urology","","","","","","","","","","","",""

2006378863|","","","","","","","AB- Introduction: In its advanced stages, hormone refractory prostate cancer (HRPC) is an incurable condition which consists of a spectrum of disease. This requires an integrated multidisciplinary approach by an uro-oncologic team supported by radiologists, skeletal surgeons and palliative care. Aim of this review was to critically evaluate the current and potential approaches to patients affected by HRPC. Materials and Methods: A comprehensive evaluation of available published data included analysis of published full-length papers that were identified with Medline and Cancerlit from January 1981 to January 2006. Official proceedings of internationally known scientific societies held in the same time period were also assessed. Results: Most men with hormone refractory prostate cancer will die of their disease in the absence of intercurrent illness, and the various conditions arising as a consequence of local and distal cancer progression commonly lead to a spectrum of morbidity requiring treatment. Recent data regarding docetaxel-based chemotherapy have shown small but significant improvements in survival and improvement in quality of life in men receiving treatment. However, this therapy may not be suitable for all patients. New agents used alone or in combination with docetaxel currently are under trial in an attempt to provide much needed improvements in outcome. Bone-targeted treatments, particularly late-generation bisphosphonates, have added to the range of options, reducing the incidence of skeletal complications in some men. Further work is needed to target their use more effectively, to explore their efficacy in combination with existing proven therapies and to develop new approaches to treat bone metastases. Complications arising as a consequence of upper and lower tract dysfunction, haematologic, neurologic and psychologic disorders are common. These complications often are amenable to effective treatment, but interventions may engender difficult clinical and ethical decisions. Conclusions: Although HRPC is incurable, it is not untreatable, and that the clinical management embraces not just chemotherapy, but many interventional and supportive therapies. A holistic and supportive approach to patient care is vital for optimal management, and is best provided by a coordinated, multidisciplinary team including urologists and oncologists.

Three drugs have recently been approved: Gleevec (imatinib mesylate) at a starting dose of 400 or 600 mg daily for the treatment of malignant unresectable and/or metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumors; Mesnex (mesna) tablets as a prophylactic agent to reduce the incidence of ifosfamide-induced hemorrhagic cystitis, and Zometa (zoledronic acid) for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma and for patients with documented bone metastases from solid tumors, in conjunction with standard antineoplastic therapy. Prostate cancer should have progressed after treatment with at least one hormonal therapy. The recommended dose and schedule is 4 mg infused over 15 minutes every 3-4 weeks. These three drugs represent three different types of drug approval: Gleevec is an accelerated approval and supplemental new drug application (NDA); Mesnex tablets represent an oral formulation of a drug approved 14 years ago as an intravenous formulation, and Zometa represents a standard NDA for a noncytotoxic, supportive-care drug.

Spinal stabilization with occipitocervical plating in a second-stage operation makes the treatment more tolerable for patients. The object of this study was to determine the effectiveness of a two-stage operation strategy for these lesions. Eight patients were operated on via anterior retropharyngeal approach and then stabilized with occipitocervical plates posteriorly in a second sitting. All neck pain and all dysphagia problems resolved. Partial neurologic improvement was achieved in three out of four patients. No postoperative infection was seen. The retropharyngeal approach to the upper cervical spine and anterior foramen magnum lesions is an effective alternative to transoral surgery because of low complication rates. Neoplastic lesions in the upper cervical spine can safely and effectively be operated with this technique. The general medical status of patients with malignancies does not permit too long, time-consuming operations.

Additionally, cancer treatments may have adverse effects on bone health. Therefore, a clear rationale exists for bone-targeted therapies to prevent skeletal complications and potentially modify the underlying disease. RECENT FINDINGS: Studies in metastatic disease have focused on refining treatment, largely through the use of bone metabolism markers. Use of bisphosphonates in early cancer has become increasingly important to prevent bone loss. Recent results, notably with zoledronic acid, indicate that bone mineral density can be maintained and increased bone turnover normalized. Bisphosphonates are potent inhibitors of bone osteolysis and may impede both the development of bone metastases and survival of dormant cells in the marrow microenvironment. Additionally, bisphosphonates may have direct effects on tumour cells, especially in combination with chemotherapy. Clinical trial results in breast cancer with clodronate were inconclusive, but recent data with zoledronic acid suggest that bisphosphonates may indeed modify the course of the disease. SUMMARY: The roles of bisphosphonates in metastatic bone disease and the prevention of cancer treatment induced bone loss have been defined. However, results from ongoing metastasis prevention trials are required before routine adjuvant bisphosphonates can be recommended","","","","","","10.1097/SPC.0b013e32832f4149 [doi]","Academic Unit of Clinical Oncology, Weston Park Hospital, University of Sheffield, WhithamRoad, Sheffield S103LZ, UK. r.e.coleman@sheffield.ac.uk","PM:19561507","","","",""

Bisphosphonates are an effective treatment for preventing skeletal-related events in patients with bone metastases and may preserve functional independence and quality of life. Although several bisphosphonates have been investigated in patients with solid tumors, only zoledronic acid (ZOL) is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency for preventing skeletal-related events in patients across a broad range of solid tumors. In addition, bisphosphonates, notably ZOL, prevent cancer treatment-induced bone loss in breast and prostate cancer patients who are receiving endocrine therapy. It also has been demonstrated that ZOL directly and indirectly inhibits cancer cell growth in vitro and growth and tumorigenesis in animal model systems. These properties may produce clinically meaningful benefits. In recent clinical studies in patients with cancer, ZOL improved overall and prolonged disease-free survival. Ongoing clinical trials in patients with solid tumors will provide further insight into the potential of ZOL to prevent distant metastases and improve survival","","","","","","","Cancer Research Centre, University of Sheffield, Weston Park Hospital, Sheffield, United Kingdom. r.e.coleman@sheffield.ac.uk","PM:21235033","","","",""

This leads to disruption of normal bone metabolism, with the increased osteoclast activity seen in most, if not all, tumor types providing a rational target for treatment. The clinical course of metastatic bone disease in multiple myeloma, breast and prostate cancers is relatively long, with patients experiencing sequential skeletal complications over a period of several years. These include bone pain, fractures, hypercalcaemia, and spinal cord compression, all of which may profoundly impair a patient's quality of life. External beam radiotherapy and systemic endocrine and cytotoxic treatments are the mainstay of treatment in advanced cancers. However, it is now clear that the bisphosphonates provide an additional treatment strategy, which reduces both the symptoms and complications of bone involvement. Pamidronate (Aredia(TM)) is the most widely evaluated bisphosphonate and is recommended for most patients with multiple myeloma or breast cancer with bone metastases. Current research aims include the evaluation of new potent bisphosphonates such as zoledronic acid (Zometa(TM)). It is hoped that this compound is not only more convenient and easier to administer but also more effective in inhibiting skeletal morbidity. Zometa may also have some direct anticancer activity. Preclinical studies with Zometa have demonstrated its potential in malignant bone disease. Clinical studies in treatment of hypercalcemia of malignancy have been completed, as have Phase I and II trials in patients with cancer and pre-existing bone metastases. Three randomized, double-blind, controlled Phase III trials are now ongoing to establish the efficacy and safety of Zometa in treatment of bone metastases in patients with osteolytic and osteoblastic lesions. Additionally, new specific molecules such as osteoprotogerin have been developed that are based on our improved understanding of the cellular signalling mechanisms involved in cancer induced bone disease. These potent molecules are now entering clinical trials. Ongoing research is aimed at trying to define the optimum route, dose, schedule and type of bisphosphonate in metastatic bone disease and their use in the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis in cancer patients. In vitro suggestions of direct anti-cancer activity and some promising clinical data in early breast cancer have resulted in considerable interest in the possible adjuvant use of bisphosphonates to inhibit the development of bone metastases","","","","","","","Department of Clinical Oncology, Cancer Research Centre, Weston Park Hospital, Whitham Road, Sheffield, S10 2SJ, UK","PM:11114866","","","",""

Bisphosphonates induce tumor cell apoptosis and reduce skeletal tumor burden in tumor xenograft models. Clinical studies with daily oral clodronate suggest that bisphosphonates can prevent bone metastases when used in the adjuvant setting, but the effect on overall survival is less certain. The more potent nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates, i.e., pamidronate and zoledronic acid, have demonstrated antitumor activity at approximately 10- to 100-fold lower concentrations than clodronate in vitro. A number of important unanswered questions must be addressed regarding the optimal use of bisphosphonates for prevention of bone metastases. For example, when should treatment begin, how long must treatment be continued, and what are the optimal dose and schedule to achieve clinically meaningful antitumor effects? Adjuvant studies of zoledronic acid in patients with breast and prostate cancer are under development, and the results are eagerly anticipated","","","","","","","Cancer Research Centre, YCR Academic Unit of Clinical Oncology, Weston Park Hospital, Sheffield S10 2SJ, UK","PM:12562049","","","",""

Bisphosphonates are the current standard of care for preventing skeletal complications associated with bone metastases. Clinical trials investigating the benefit of bisphosphonate therapy have used a composite end point defined as a skeletal-related event (SRE) or bone event, which typically includes pathologic fracture, spinal cord compression, radiation or surgery to bone, and HCM. Bisphosphonates have been shown to significantly reduce the incidence of these events in patients with bone metastases. Zoledronic acid (Zometa; Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corp.; East Hanover, NJ), pamidronate (Aredia; Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corp.), clodronate (Bonefos; Anthra Pharmaceuticals; Princeton, NJ), and ibandronate (Bondronat; Hoffmann-La Roche Inc.; Nutley, NJ) all have demonstrated efficacy superior to that of placebo in patients with breast cancer. Zoledronic acid is the only bisphosphonate that has been compared directly with pamidronate, and it was shown by multiple event analysis to be significantly more effective at reducing the risk of an SRE. In patients with prostate cancer, clodronate, etidronate (Didronel; Procter and Gamble Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; Cincinnati, OH), and pamidronate have demonstrated transient palliation of bone pain. However, zoledronic acid is the only bisphosphonate to demonstrate both significant and sustained pain reduction and a significantly lower incidence and longer time to onset of SREs compared with placebo. Zoledronic acid is also the only bisphosphonate to demonstrate efficacy in patients with bone metastases from a variety of other solid tumors, including lung cancer and renal cell carcinoma. In conclusion, bisphosphonates effectively reduce skeletal complications in patients with bone metastases from breast cancer, and zoledronic acid has demonstrated the broadest clinical activity in patients with a wide variety of tumor types","","","","","","10.1634/theoncologist.9-90004-14 [doi];9/suppl_4/14 [pii]","Academic Unit of Clinical Oncology, Cancer Research Centre, Weston Park Hospital, Whitham Road, Sheffield, England S10 2SJ, United Kingdom. r.e.coleman@sheffield.ac.uk","PM:15459426","","","",""

These trials provide an opportunity for investigating the correlation between bone metabolism and clinical outcome during bisphosphonate therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Urinary measurements of N-telopeptide (Ntx) and serum bone alkaline phosphatase (BAP) were obtained in 1,824 bisphosphonate-treated patients-1,462 with zoledronic acid (breast, 490; prostate, 411; myeloma, 210; non-small-cell lung, 183; other, 168) and 362 with pamidronate (breast, 254; myeloma, 108). This exploratory cohort analysis grouped patients by baseline and most recent levels of Ntx as low (< 50 nmol/mmol creatinine), moderate (50 to 99 nmol/mmol creatinine), or high (> or = 100 nmol/mmol creatinine), and BAP as low (< 146 U/L) or high (> or = 146 U/L). The relative risks for negative clinical outcomes were estimated for each group using multiple-event and Cox regression models with time-varying covariates. RESULTS: Patients with high and moderate Ntx levels had 2-fold increases in their risk of skeletal complications and disease progression compared with patients with low Ntx levels (P < .001 for all). High Ntx levels in each solid tumor category were associated with a 4- to 6-fold increased risk of death on study, and moderate Ntx levels a 2- to 4-fold increased risk compared with low Ntx levels (P < .001 for all). Bone alkaline phosphatase also showed some correlation with risk of negative clinical outcomes. CONCLUSION: The bone resorption marker Ntx provides valuable prognostic information in patients with bone metastases receiving bisphosphonates","","","","","","JCO.2005.06.091 [pii];10.1200/JCO.2005.06.091 [doi]","Yorkshire Cancer Research Academic Unit of Clinical Oncology, Weston Park Hospital, Sheffield S10 2SJ, England, UK. r.e.coleman@sheffield.ac.uk","PM:15983391","","","",""

Skeletal morbidity includes pain that requires radiotherapy, hypercalcemia, pathologic fracture, and spinal cord or nerve root compression. From randomized trials in advanced cancer, it can be seen that one of these major skeletal events occurs on average every 3 to 6 months. Additionally, metastatic disease may remain confined to the skeleton with the decline in quality of life and eventual death almost entirely due to skeletal complications and their treatment. The prognosis of metastatic bone disease is dependent on the primary site, with breast and prostate cancers associated with a survival measured in years compared with lung cancer, where the average survival is only a matter of months. Additionally, the presence of extraosseous disease and the extent and tempo of the bone disease are powerful predictors of outcome. The latter is best estimated by measurement of bone-specific markers, and recent studies have shown a strong correlation between the rate of bone resorption and clinical outcome, both in terms of skeletal morbidity and progression of the underlying disease or death. Our improved understanding of prognostic and predictive factors may enable delivery of a more personalized treatment for the individual patient and a more cost-effective use of health care resources","","","","","","12/20/6243s [pii];10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-06-0931 [doi]","Academic Unit of Medical Oncology, Weston Park Hospital, Sheffield, United Kingdom. r.e.coleman@sheffield.ac.uk","PM:17062708","","","",""

Therefore, there has been great interest in the development of clinical therapies to prevent bone metastases. Bisphosphonates are currently used for the treatment of bone metastases secondary to solid tumors, including tumors of the breast, prostate, and lung. Current evidence indicates that nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates may have antitumor potential. Preclinical studies using in vitro and in vivo cancer models have shown that zoledronic acid, a third-generation bisphosphonate, can inhibit angiogenesis, invasion and adhesion of tumor cells, and overall tumor progression. Furthermore, pilot clinical studies suggest that zoledronic acid can prevent bone metastases, and larger clinical trials are under way (AZURE, NSABP-B-34, S0307, ZEUS, G2419) to examine the use of bisphosphonates for prevention of bone metastases in adjuvant therapy settings. Biochemical markers of bone turnover and tumor markers are being characterized and may provide useful tools to identify high-risk patients who may especially benefit from bisphosphonate therapy","","","","","","S0093-7754(07)00205-9 [pii];10.1053/j.seminoncol.2007.10.003 [doi]","Cancer Research Centre, Head, Academic Unit of Clinical Oncology, Weston Park Hospital, Sheffield, UK. r.e.coleman@sheffield.ac.uk","PM:18068485","","","",""

METHODS: Data from 257 patients treated with Flutamide or Cyproterone acetate within the EORTC GU Group protocol 30892 have been used and analysis by Cox models. RESULTS: A PSA response defined as a decrease to < or = 1 ng/ml and to between 1 and 10 ng/ml was associated with a hazard ratio of 0.30 and 0.61 for overall survival, respectively, as compared to the non-responders (PSA> 10 ng/ml). Five definitions of PSA progression were considered: (1) a confirmed or (2) a repeated doubling of the PSA over nadir and unconfirmed (3) 100%, (4) 50% and (5) 20% increase of the PSA over nadir, each to a value > 4 ng/ml. Definition (5) was the most sensitive with sensitivity 76.20% and specificity 32.08%. With this definition, 70.0% of the patients had a PSA progression, which occurred in median 1.98 years before death. CONCLUSIONS: For good prognosis metastatic prostate cancer patients under anti-androgen treatment, PSA response at 6 months with cut-off levels of < or = 1 ng/ml and < or = 10 ng/ml is prognostic for survival. A 20% increase over nadir to a value > 4 ng/ml is prognostic for a poor survival with a 76.20% sensitivity. In this study, confirmation of the increase by a second observation did not seem necessary.

Few prognostic factors have been identified so far. We examined whether baseline health-related quality of life (HRQOL) parameters assessed by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire C30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) were independent prognostic factors of survival and whether they bring extra precision to the predictions achievable with models based on clinical and biochemical factors only. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data of 391 symptomatic (bone) metastatic HRPC patients from three randomized EORTC trials were used in multivariate Cox proportional hazards models. The significance level was set at alpha =.05. RESULTS: Of the 391 patients, 371 died, most of prostate cancer. Bone scan result, performance status, hemoglobin level, and insomnia and appetite loss as measured by the EORTC QLQ-C30 were independent predictors of survival. This model's area under the receiver operating curve was 0.65 compared with 0.63 without the two HRQOL factors. CONCLUSION: Certain HRQOL sores, at baseline, seem to be predictors for duration of survival in HRPC. However, such measurements do not add to the predictive ability of models based only on clinical and biochemical factors","","","","","","10.1200/JCO.2004.07.089 [doi];22/19/3877 [pii]","European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer, Data Center-Biostatistics, Ave E.

effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of docetaxel (Taxotere(R), Sanofi-Aventis) in combination with prednisone/prednisolone for the treatment of metastatic hormone-refractory prostate cancer (mHRPC). The main comparators considered were other established chemotherapy regimens and best supportive care. Data sources: Twenty-one resources (inclu ding MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library) were searched to April 2005. Review methods: Two reviewers independently assessed studies for inclusion. Data from included studies were extracted and quality assessed. Where appropriate, outcomes were synthesised using formal analytic approaches. A new economic model was developed in order to establish the cost-effectiveness of docetaxel compared with a range of potential comparators. A separate review was undertaken to identify sources of utility data required to estimate quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Sensitivity analyses were also undertaken to explore the robustness of the main analysis to alternative assumptions related to quality of life. Monte Carlo simulation was used to propagate uncertainty in input parameters through the model in such a way that the results of the analysis could be presented with their uncertainty. The impact of uncertainty surrounding the decision was established using value of information and implementation approaches. Results: Seven randomised controlled trials were identified that met the inclusion criteria. A direct comparison of docetaxel plus prednisone versus mitoxantrone plus prednisone in an open-label randomised trial showed improved outcomes for docetaxel plus pr ednisone in terms of overall survival, quality of life, pain and prostate-specific antigen decline. Two other chemotherapy regimens that included docetaxel: docetaxel plus estramustine and docetaxel plus prednisone plus estramustine, also showed improved outcomes in comparison with mitoxantrone plus prednisone. Indirect comparison suggested that docetaxel plus prednisone seems to be superior to corticosteroids alone in terms of overall survival. Conclusions on cost-effectiveness were primarily informed by the results of the in-house model. This indicated that mitoxantrone plus a corticosteroid is probably cheaper and more effective than corticosteroid alone. Compared with mitoxantrone plus prednisone/prednisolone, the use of docetaxel plus prednisone/ prednisolone (3-weekly) appears cost-effective only if the NHS is prepared to pay Pounds33,000 per QALY. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio associated with docetaxel plus prednisone (3-weekly) remained fairly robust to these variations with estimates ranging from Pounds28,000 to Pounds33,000 per QALY. Value of information analysis revealed that further research is potentially valuable. Given a maximum acceptable ratio of per mil 30,000 per QALY, the expected value of information was estimated to be approximately per mil13 million. Conclusions: This systematic review of the research suggests that docetaxel plus prednisone seems to be the most effective treatment for men with mHRPC. The economic model suggests that treatment with docetaxel plus prednisone/prednisolone is cost-effective in patients with mHRPC provided the NHS is prepared to pay Pounds33,000 per additional QALY. Future research should include the direct assessment of quality of life and utility gain associated with different treatments, including the effect of adverse events of treatment, using generic instruments, which are suitable for the purposes of cost-effectiveness analyses.

Bisphosphonates are effective inhibitors of bone resorption and reduce the risk of skeletal complications in patients with bone metastases. The standard routes of administration for bisphosphonates used in clinical practice are either oral or i.v. infusion. Oral administration of bisphosphonates is complicated by poor bioav ailability (generally <5%) and poor gastrointestinal tolerability. First-generation bisphosphonates, such as clodronate (Bonefos(R); Anthra Pharmaceuticals; Princeton, NJ), must be administered at high oral doses (1,600-3,200 mg/day) to achieve therapeutic effects, which leads to poor tolerability and compliance with oral dosing regimens. Infusion of bisphosphonates is associated with dose- and infusion-rate-dependent effects on renal function. In particular, high bisphosphonate doses (e.g., 1,500 mg clodronate) can cause severe renal toxicity unless infused slowly over many hours. In contrast, the newer, more potent bisphosphonates effectively inhibit bone resorp tion at micromolar concentrations, and the small doses required can be administered via relatively short i.v. infusions without adversely affecting renal function. Zoledronic acid (Zometa(R); Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corp.; East Hanover, NJ) is a new generation bisphosphonate, and the recommended dose of 4 mg can be safely infused over 15 minutes. The 90-mg dose of pamidronate (Aredia(R); Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corp.) and the 6-mg dose of ibandronate (Bondronat(R); Hoffmann-La Roche Inc.; Nutley, NJ) require 1- to 41-hour infusions. Intravenous bisphosphonates require less frequent dosing (once a month) and are generally well tolerated with long-term use in patients with bone metastases. Zoledronic acid has demonstrated the broadest clinical activity in patients with bone metastases","","","","","","","","","","","",""

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study design was observational and inclusion criteria required subjects with prostate cancer patients who were first diagnosed with metastatic bone disease not more than 18 months before. For each patient recruited to the study, a retrospective evaluation and a prospective surveillance were undertaken. RESULTS: One hundred and ninety-nine patients were enrolled at 32 urological centers in Italy. The median age of participants at first visit was 72.7 years (SD = 7.8). Mean PSA at onset was 323.6 (SD = 1058.3) and these values strongly correlated with Gleason score (Spearman r = 0.228; p = 0.003). The main cause for suspicion of bone metastasis was routine follow up (53%), followed by pathological fracture (31%). Main metastasis sites were located at femur (43.2%), lumbar sacral spine (39.7%), cervical spine (38.2%) and ribs (33.7%). With regard to the main types of bone metastases identified, 27.6% were sclerotic, 5% were lytic and 21.1% were mixed. The specialist who most frequently suspected bone metastasis and referred patients for diagnostic assessment was an urologist (84.9%). CONCLUSIONS: The present survey is a multicentric study with the main aim to identify features of prostate cancer patients with bone metastases. This survey confirmed that suspicion of bone metastasis is motivated by pain symptoms only in a small percentage of patients with prostate cancer, which testifies to both the difficulty of diagnosis and the need and usefulness of accurate regular follow up","","","","","","","Azienda Ospedaliera Sant'Anna Como, UO Urologia. giario.conti@auro.it","PM:18683811","","","",""

Also scintigraphic flare of SM can occur following effective treatment and mislead an early response assessment. We hypothesised that a flare reaction might amplify the signal from subclinical SM, increasing the sensitivity of BS and that the phenomenon may be specific for metastases. METHODS: We conducted a prospective study to determine the frequency of the flare phenomenon in patients with metastatic PC starting hormone therapy and to explore its utility in patients with negative staging scans but considered at high risk of SM and in those with equivocal baseline BS abnormalities. Ninety-nine patients commencing first-line hormone therapy had repeat BS at 6 weeks to score a flare reaction. RESULTS: Of 22 patients with unequivocal SM on the baseline scan, a flare occurred in 9 (41%). Of 36 high-risk localised prostate cancer patients with normal BS pre-treatment, the scan became positive for metastases at 6 weeks in 4 (11%). Of 41 patients with pre-treatment scintigraphic abnormalities of uncertain aetiology, a flare occurred in 8 cases (20%). All eight were confirmed to have SM by follow-up and imaging. Of the 33 remaining patients without a flare, 2 developed SM at 14 months and the remainder did not develop SM in a median follow-up period of 36 months. CONCLUSION: The flare phenomenon following initial hormone therapy can be used to improve both sensitivity and specificity of BS in PC","","","","","","10.1007/s00259-010-1576-0 [doi]","Department of Nuclear Medicine and PET, Royal Marsden Hospital, Downs Rd, Sutton, Surrey, SM2 5PT, UK. gary.cook@rmh.nhs.uk","PM:20697891","","","",""

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The 643 subjects in this report were participants in multicenter randomized controlled trial of zoledronic acid in men with metastatic prostate cancer. All subjects had bone metastases and disease progression despite medical or surgical castration. Relationships between baseline covariates and overall survival were examined by Cox proportional hazard model. Serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP) and urinary N-telopeptide were assessed as representative specific markers of osteoblast and osteoclast activity, respectively. Other covariates in the model were age, log prostate-specific antigen, hemoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase, albumin, analgesic use, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status. RESULTS: Serum BAP was significantly correlated with urinary N-telopeptide (correlation coefficient = 0.674; 95% confidence interval, 0.628-0.715; P < 0.0001). In univariate analyses, higher levels of serum BAP and urinary N-telopeptide levels were significantly associated with shorter overall survival. After controlling for the other variables, including N-telopeptide, in multivariate models, higher serum BAP levels were consistently associated with shorter survival. In contrast, urinary N-telopeptide levels were not significantly associated with survival in multivariate analyses. Variables retained in the reduced multivariate model were age, log prostate-specific antigen, hemoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase, analgesic use, and BAP. CONCLUSIONS: Serum BAP significantly correlates with urinary N-telopeptide in men with androgen-independent prostate cancer and bone metastases. In multivariate models, higher levels of serum BAP but not urinary N-telopeptide are associated with shorter overall survival","","","","","","12/11/3361 [pii];10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-06-0269 [doi]","Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada","PM:16740758","","","",""

Presently, there is no cure for patients with androgen-independent prostate cancer. In order to develop more effective therapies for this disease, the molecular events involved in the development of androgen independence and bone metastasis must be elucidated and then targeted by therapeutic agents. Several studies presented at a recent conference on prostate cancer sponsored by the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) provided evidence that prostate cancer metastasis to bone is mediated by the prostate cancer cell expression of molecules that allow the cells to invade, grow in and stimulate cells in the bone microenviron ment resulting in an osteoblastic reaction. Androgen independence was reportedly mediated by an increased expression of survival genes following androgen ablation therapies and several molecular mechanisms involved in genetic instability. Treatment strategies are being designed to target some of the molecular events involved in androgen independence and bone metastasis. Targeting these molecular events with combinational therapies will hopefully delay the progression to androgen independence in patients with early stage disease, suppress the growth of androgen-independent cells in patients with advanced disease and enhance the chemosensitivity of androgen-independent cells. 2002 (c) Ashley Publications Ltd","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We assessed the accuracy of the Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment (CAPRA) score, which was validated previously to predict pathological and biochemical outcomes after radical prostatectomy, to predict metastases, prostate cancer-specific mortality, and all-cause mortality. METHODS: We studied 10 627 men with clinically localized prostate cancer in the Cancer of the Prostate Strategic Urologic Research Endeavor registry, who underwent primary radical prostatectomy, radiation therapy (external beam or interstitial), androgen deprivation monotherapy, or watchful waiting/active surveillance, and had at least 6 months of follow-up after treatment. CAPRA scores were calculated at diagnosis from the prostate-specific antigen level, Gleason score, percentage of biopsy cores that were positive for cancer, clinical tumor stage, and age at diagnosis. Survival was studied with Kaplan-Meier analyses. Associations between increasing CAPRA scores and bone metastasis, cancer-specific mortality, and all-cause mortality were examined by use of proportional hazards regression, with adjustment for primary treatment; for all-cause mortality, the analysis also included adjustment for age and comorbidity. Accuracy of the CAPRA score was assessed with the concordance (c)-index. RESULTS: Among the 10 627 patients, 311 (2.9%) men developed bone metastases, 251 (2.4%) died of prostate cancer, and 1582 (14.9%) died of other causes. Each single-point increase in the CAPRA score was associated with increased bone metastases (hazard ratio [HR] for bone metastases = 1.47, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.39 to 1.56), cancer-specific mortality (HR for prostate cancer death = 1.39, 95% CI = 1.31 to 1.48), and all-cause mortality (HR for death = 1.13, 95% CI = 1.10 to 1.16). The CAPRA score was accurate for predicting metastases (c-index = 0.78), cancer-specific mortality (c-index = 0.80), and all-cause mortality (c-index = 0.71). CONCLUSIONS: In a large cohort of patients with clinically localized prostate cancer who were managed with one of five primary modalities, the CAPRA score predicted clinical prostate cancer endpoints with good accuracy. These results support the value of the CAPRA score as a risk assessment and stratification tool for both research studies and clinical practice","","","","","","djp122 [pii];10.1093/jnci/djp122 [doi]","Department of Urology, University of California-San Francisco, 1600 Divisadero Street A-607, San Francisco, CA 94143-1695, USA. mcooperberg@urology.ucsf.edu","PM:19509351","","","",""

Immunotherapy has held promise of improved outcomes based on uncontrolled studies and randomized controlled trials generally limited by small size and low power. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate immunotherapy for advanced renal cell carcinoma by comparing: (1) high dose interleukin-2 to other options and (2) interferon-alfa to other options. The primary outcome of interest was overall survival at one year, with remission as the main secondary outcome of interest. SEARCH STRATEGY: A systematic search of the CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE databases was conducted for the period 1966 through end of 2005. Handsearches were made of the proceedings of the periodic meetings of the American Urologic Association, the American Society of Clinical Oncology, ECCO - the European Cancer Conference, and the European Society of Medical Oncology for the period 1995 to 2005. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials that selected (or stratified) patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma, utilized an immunotherapeutic agent in at least one study arm, and reported remission or survival by allocation. Fifty-eight identified studies involving 6880 patients were eligible and all but one reported remission; thirty-seven of these studies reported the one-year survival outcome. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers independently abstracted each article by following a prospectively designed protocol. Dichotomous outcomes for treatment remission (partial plus complete) and for deaths at one year were used for the main comparisons. Survival hazard ratios were also used for studies of interferon-alfa versus controls. MAIN RESULTS: Combined data for a variety of immunotherapies gave an overall chance of partial or complete remission of only 12.4%, compared to 2.4% in non-immunotherapy control arms. Twenty-eight percent of these remissions were designated as complete (data from 51 studies). Median survival averaged 13 months (range by arm, 6 to 28 months). The difference in remission rate between arms was poorly correlated with the difference in median survival so that remission rate is not a good surrogate or intermediate outcome for survival for advanced renal cancer. We were unable to identify any published randomized study of high-dose interleukin-2 versus a non-immunotherapy control, or of high-dose interleukin-2 versus interferon-alfa reporting survival. High dose interleukin-2 did not give better overall survival compared to the same therapy at one tenth the dose or to subcutaneous cytokine therapy, but may improve survival in the patients with bad prognostic factors based on subset analysis. Results from four studies (644 patients) suggest that interferon-alfa is superior to controls (OR for death at one year = 0.56, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.77). Using the method of Parmar 1998*, the pooled overall HR for death was 0.74 (95% CI 0.63 to 0.88). Of concern, a recent study currently available as a meeting report did not find a benefit to interferon-alfa in patients with advanced renal cell cancer of intermediate prognosis. The optimal dose and duration of interferon-alfa remains to be elucidated. The addition of a variety of enhancers, including lower dose intravenous or subcutaneous interleukin-2, has failed to improve survival compared to interferon-alfa alone. Two randomized studies have examined the role of initial nephrectomy prior to interferon-alfa therapy in highly selected fit patients with metastases at diagnosis and minimal symptoms; despite minimal improvement in the chance of remission, both studies of up-front nephrectomy improved median survival over interferon-alfa alone in this selected population. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Interferon-alfa provides a modest survival benefit compared to other commonly used treatments. In fit patients with metastases at diagnosis and minimal symptoms, nephrectomy followed by interferon-alfa gives the best survival strategy for fully validated therapies. The need for more effective specific therapy for this condition is apparent. IMMUNOTHERAPY FOR ADVANCED KIDNEY CANCER: Cancer originating in the kidney in adults, known as renal cell carcinoma, is an important health problem (childhood Wilms' tumour is a different condition not covered in this review). The condition is rarely curable if it has spread to other organs at the time of diagnosis, if spread appears after initial removal of the affected kidney, or the kidney tumour is too extensive for surgery. Kidney cancer is resistant to conventional chemotherapy. The observation that these tumours can occasionally shrink without therapy, especially when spread to the lungs, suggested that drugs that work through the patient's immune system might be a useful approach. Because the course of kidney cancer is very variable between patients, studies were only included if patients consented to be randomly allocated to have the immunotherapy of interest or a control therapy. Any type of immunotherapy was accepted for inclusion in this survey.A systematic search of reports published between 1966 and 2005 identified 58 different studies of immunotherapy in 6880 patients with advanced renal cell cancer. Thirty-seven studies reported the main outcome of interest, the chance of surviving for one year for each treatment tested. One study provides useful information about the effect of placebo, with 6% of patients having a partial remission and 25% having stable disease for more than six months. Other studies used hormone pills as control therapy, probably inactive agents. Of the many types of immunotherapy that have been tested, only interferon-alfa has been shown to improve the chance of surviving for one year. Interferon-alfa is normally made by white blood cells in response to viral infections. Originally obtained from human blood in tiny impure amounts, interferon-alfa can now be made as a pure product and is given by injection under the skin, usually three times per week. Four studies tested interferon-alfa in 644 patients with advanced kidney cancer and, compared to control therapy, this agent reduced the risk of death at one year by 46% and risk of death over the course of two years by 36%. The treatment has a low chance of shrinking cancers with partial remission seen in only 12.5% of patients. These studies included a representative sample of patients as long as they were ambulatory and without spread to the brain. Interferon-alfa therapy is very safe but causes an unpleasant flu-like syndrome of variable severity that tends to improve as treatment continues, with fatigue and loss of appetite.Attempts to enhance the benefit of interferon-alfa by adding other drugs have been unsuccessful with the possible exception of adding cis-retinoic acid, related to Vitamin A, and this approach resulted in worse quality-of-life than interferon-alfa alone. However, in patients whose kidney cancer has visibly spread at the time of diagnosis, removing the kidney before giving interferon-alfa prolonged average survival by six months (two studies, combined data), the most impressive effect of any treatment for advanced kidney cancer so far demonstrated including the new targeted agents (see separate review). It has been suggested that the removal of the primary kidney tumour works by unblocking the patient's immune system but it is unknown if this procedure can be counted as an immune approach.One goal of this review was to assess the benefit of high dose interleukin-2, an expensive and toxic treatment that was the only approved therapy for advanced kidney cancer in the United States at the time of the most recent review update in 2006. No studies of high dose interleukin-2 compared to a non-immunotherapy control were identified. High dose interleukin-2 gives equivalent survival to low dose interleukin-2 plus interferon-alfa, a combination known to have greater toxicity than interferon-alfa alone.The main limitation of the studies surveyed in this review was their small size with consequent limited ability to demonstrate differences in<Abstract truncated>","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Targeted agents inhibit known molecular pathways involved in cellular proliferation and neoangiogenesis, the induction by the tumour of host microvascular networks. Angiogenesis is of special interest in the clear cell histologic subtype of renal cancer because of its vascularity and constitutively activated hypoxia-inducible path in the majority of tumours. OBJECTIVES: 1) To provide a systematic review of studies testing targeted agents. 2) To identify the type and degree of clinical benefit, if any, of targeted agents over the prior standard of care, particularly any impact on overall survival. SEARCH STRATEGY: 1) Electronic search of CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EMBASE databases. 2) Hand search of international cancer meeting abstract and other sources specified in the protocol. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled studies of targeted agents in patients with advanced renal cell cancer reporting major remission rate or overall survival by allocation. Progression-free survival (PFS) was adopted as an additional outcome because PFS was a commonly chosen primary outcome, and because several pivotal studies allowed crossover from the control to the investigational arm after closure to accrual thereby making overall survival a problematic endpoint. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Nineteen fully eligible studies tested ten different targeted agents (Table 04). One additional study was excluded because no outcome data by allocation have been reported (Hutson 2007). For purposes of comparison, the studies were divided into three groups: Group 1 studies compared different doses of the same agents; Group 2 studies examined the impact of targeted agents in patients who had received prior cytokine or other systemic therapy; and Group 3 studies tested targeted agents in systemically naive patients, either against standard interferon-alfa or against another control therapy. Meta-analysis was not utilized because there were very few situations where the same agents had been tested in the same group in more than one study. MAIN RESULTS: In systemically untreated patients in studies using subcutaneous interferon-alfa as control therapy, the major findings were: 1) An improvement in overall survival has been demonstrated only with the use of weekly intravenous temsirolimus in patients with unselected renal cancer histology and adverse prognostic features (median survival 10.9 months versus 7.3 months for temsirolimus or interferon-alfa respectively, HR 0.73, P = 0.008 log rank, Hudes 2007). However, the chance of major remission was low and not improved with temsirolimus. 2) In patients with mostly good or intermediate prognostic risk with clear cell renal cancer, oral sunitinib improves the chance of major remission, the probability of symptomatic improvement, and freedom from disease progression (Motzer 2007); in a similar setting, the addition of biweekly intravenous bevacizumab to interferon-alfa also improved the chance of major remission and prolonged progression-free survival (Escudier 2007b); overall survival had not changed at the time of interim reporting of either study.In patients with clear cell renal cancers who had failed prior cytokine therapy, oral sorafenib gives a better quality of life than placebo as well as improved chance of being free of disease progression; overall survival may have improved but is hard to evaluate because of crossover of placebo-assigned patients after the study closed to accrual (Escudier 2007a). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Based on less than a decade of experience, some targeted agents with specified molecular targets have demonstrated clinically useful benefits over the previous standard of care for patients with advanced renal cancer. Much more research is required to fully establish the role of targeted agents in this condition. NEW DRUG TREATMENTS FOR KIDNEY CANCER: Drug treatment for advanced kidney cancer has been unsatisfactory, with a low chance of temporary remission, small improvement in average survival, and substantial toxicity. Recent advances in understanding the molecular biology of common kidney cancer have resulted in the development of drugs that target known molecular pathways. This review critically examines clinical trials that have directly compared the new targeted 'designer' drugs with previous standard therapy for this condition. Patients consented to be randomly assigned to standard therapy or the test program.A systematic survey of reports published since 2000 identified 19 studies that looked at 10 different new drugs in a total of over 5000 patients. Seven studies were only available as preliminary reports, and 5 included less than 100 patients. The patients were generally representative of those with this condition except for a common requirement for patients to be fully ambulatory, and the cancer usually to be of the clear cell subtype and not to have spread to the brain. Our analysis was conducted separately for studies of patients who had received prior standard drug treatment or not. A few studies looked at the effects of different doses of new drugs.Only one reviewed study demonstrated statistical improvement in survival. Compared to interferon-alfa, the common previous standard of care, a targeted drug given by vein once a week called temsirolimus was shown in a single study to improve average survival from 7.3 to 10.9 months in a group of previously untreated patients with clinical features predictive of unfavourable prognosis. The chance of major side effects was less with the new drug. In untreated patients with unselected prognosis, a drug given daily by mouth called sunitinib resulted in more major remissions and longer time to worsening of the cancer, effects that were associated with better quality of life than standard interferon-alfa. It is too soon to assess any impact on survival. Another study found similar benefit by giving bevacizumab by vein alternate weeks in addition to interferon-alfa.The best outcomes for patients who had received prior drug therapy were seen with an oral targeted drug called sorafenib, with delayed disease worsening and better symptom control than placebo.These studies suggest that some of the new drugs will provide better outcomes for this drug resistant condition but much additional clinical research is required (see Coppin 2004*)","","","","","","","","","","","",""

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A systematic search of published evidence was performed using Medline (1969 to September 2010). RESULTS: Androgen-dependency of prostate growth is evident only in the hypogonadal condition, but not in the eugonadal state (the 'saturation hypothesis'). There is unequivocal evidence that reducing androgen signaling to the hypogonadal range can reduce PC growth and patient symptoms. At physiological testosterone concentration there is no link between androgen levels and PC risk. In addition, different strategies of androgen deprivation (ADT) for advanced PC are only palliative and rarely cure patients. Preliminary evidence indicates that a low androgen milieu is associated with tumor aggressiveness. Transition to androgen-independence is complex and involves both selection and outgrowth of preexisting androgen resistant clones, as well as adaptative upregulation of genes that help the cancer cells to survive and grow after ADT. Because androgens are essential for the regulation of fat distribution, insulin sensitivity, and lipid and bone metabolism, recent publications have highlighted the concept that ADT may also be involved with an increase in overall, as well as cardiovascular, morbidity and mortality. CONCLUSIONS: While ADT still represents a cornerstone for the palliative therapy of a small fraction of aggressive PC, a 'misuse and/or abuse' of ADT should be avoided","","","","","","7501 [pii];10.3275/7501 [doi]","Sexual Medicine and Andrology Unit, Department of Clinical Physiopathology, University of Florence, Viale Pieraccini 6, 50139 Florence, Italy","PM:21297383","","","",""

The primary role of bisphosphonates for the management of bone metastases in patients with advanced-stage cancer is the prevention of these painful skeletal complications. In placebo-controlled trials, a number of bisphosphonates, including oral clodronate, oral and intravenous (I.V.) ibandronate, I.V. pamidronate, and I.V. zoledronic acid, have been shown to significantly reduce skeletal complications in patients with bone metastases from breast cancer. Furthermore, zoledronic acid provided benefit compared with pamidronate in patients with bone metastases from breast cancer in a large, comparative trial. Zoledronic acid also provided long-term benefits in randomized placebo-controlled trials in patients with bone metastases from prostate cancer, lung cancer, and other solid tumors, whereas other bisphosphonates that have been investigated have failed to demonstrate objective long-term benefits in placebo-controlled trials. In addition, although systemic analgesics and radiation therapy are primary treatments for the management of bone pain, bisphosphonates can also play an important secondary role in reducing bone pain associated with skeletal metastases. Notably, several economic analyses of bisphosphonate therapy have demonstrated that these agents are cost-effective by reducing health-care costs associated with skeletal complications and providing clinically significant quality of life benefits to patients with malignant bone disease","","","","","","D5227456J2117078 [pii];10.3816/SCT.2006.n.012 [doi]","Hospital de Santa Maria, Faculdade de Medicina de Lisboa, Lisbon, Portugal","PM:18632488","","","",""

Hormonal therapy commonly consists of injection of gonadotropin hormone-releasing hormone agonists. Based on the need for improved convenience of administration, a novel formulation of leuprolide acetate (Eligard(R); Atrix Laboratories Inc. & Sanofi Aventis) which incorporates a mixture of selected polymers and solvents to achieve sustained drug delivery after subcutaneous injection, was developed. The US Food and Drug Administ ration has approved 1-, 3-, 4- and 6-month formulations of leuprolide acetate. In clinical trials, leuprolide acetate achieves sustained suppression of serum testosterone to castration levels (<=50 ng/dl). The adverse-event profile is consistent with the effects of testosterone suppression. This novel delivery system in addition to the availability of a 6-month formulation of leuprolide acetate, offers patients the option of a convenient twice-yearly injection schedule","","","","","","","","","","","",""

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-three patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC) were included in the study from May 2000 to April 2004. Their median age was 71 years (range, 56-81) and their median Karnofsky performance status (KPS) was 90 (range, 70-100). The treatment schedule consisted of intravenous (i.v.) mitoxantrone (8 mg/m2 on day 1), i.v. gemcitabine 800 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8, recycled every 21 days and oral prednisone administered at a dose of 10 mg per day. Hormonal treatment with LHRH was continued in all patients. Up to six cycles of treatment were planned in the absence of progressive disease. RESULTS: Sixteen patients had measurable disease (six patients only measurable disease, ten patients bone disease plus measurable disease) and 27 patients had only bone disease. Concerning the PSA levels, a partial response (PR) was observed in 15 patients (38%), stable disease (SD) in 16 patients (41%) and progressive disease (PD) in eight patients (21%). The objective response was evaluable in 16 patients; one patient was not evaluable because he had received only one cycle. Ten patients (63%) had SD and five patients (31%) PD. In the ten evaluable patients with objective SD, depending upon the PSA response, three PR, six SD and one PD were observed. Among the five patients who progressed, three PD and two SD were observed as a PSA response. Pain remission was recorded in 15/41 patients (36%) and the KPS remained stable in most patients. The median overall survival was 15 months (range, 1-41) (95% CI: 10-20 months). The 1-year survival rate was 61%. Hematological toxicity was mild: G 3-4 neutropenia was observed in five (12%) patients. There were no neutropenic, fevers. No significant non-hematological toxicity was observed. CONCLUSION: The mitoxantrone, gemcitabine and prednisone combination, in accordance with the present regimen, was feasible, had a palliative effect, good tolerance and antitumor activity. Nonetheless, our results do not seem to be superior to those previously described for mitoxantrone plus prednisone","","","","","","","Medical Oncology Unit, S.

The threshold for re-treatment may be lower after a single fraction but this can be conducted simply and effectively and does not negate the convenience for the patient, or the cost-effectiveness of this approach. A more protracted fractionation scheme may be justified in the occasional patient who is predicted to have a particularly long life expectancy. For multiple painful sites on the same side of the diaphragm, hemi-body radiotherapy is rapidly effective. Pre-medication with odansetron and steroids will minimize side effects and eliminate the need for hospitalization. When multiple painful sites exist on both sides of the diaphragm, systemic radiopharmaceuticals can be considered; however, systemic radiopharmaceuticals will not treat adjacent soft tissue disease or neurologic compromise. External radiotherapy remains the treatment of choice under these circumstances. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved","","","","","","","","","","","",""

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Baseline, treatment and followup information was compiled on a cohort of 8,669 patients with prostate cancer treated with surgery (5,918) or radiation (2,751) from January 1, 1988 to January 1, 2002 for clinical stage T1c-4NxMo prostate cancer, forming the study cohort. Cox regression analysis was used to test whether Prentice criteria were violated in this cohort. RESULTS: After PSA defined recurrence PSA-DT less than 3 months and the specific value of PSA-DT at 3 months or greater were statistically significantly associated with time to PCSM and with time to all cause mortality after PSA defined recurrence (each Cox p <0.001). Treatment received was not statistically significant associated with time to PCSM following PSA defined recurrence in patients with PSA-DT less than 3 months (Cox p = 0.90) and in patients with PSA-DT 3 months or greater (Cox p = 0.28). Furthermore, after PSA defined recurrence PSA-DT less than 3 months was statistically significantly associated with PCSM (HR 19.6, 95% CI 12.5 to 30.9). CONCLUSIONS: Posttreatment PSA-DT appears to be a surrogate end point for PCSM following surgery or radiation therapy. We recommend that consideration should be given to enrollment onto a clinical trial and/or initiating androgen suppression therapy at the time of PSA defined recurrence when PSA-DT is less than 3 months to delay the imminent sequelae of metastatic bone disease","","","","","","","Department of Radiation Oncology, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts 02215, USA. adamico@lroc.harvard.edu","PM:15535442","","","",""

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study cohort comprised 919 men treated from 1988 to 2002 at 1 of 44 institutions with surgery (560) or radiation therapy (359) for clinical stages T1c-4NxMo prostate cancer, followed by salvage hormonal therapy for PSA failure. All patients experienced PSA defined recurrence while on hormonal therapy. Prentice criteria require that the surrogate should be a prognostic factor and the treatment used did not alter time to PCSM following achievement of the surrogate end point. These criteria were tested using Cox regression. All statistical tests were 2-sided. RESULTS: PSA velocity greater than 1.5 ng/ml yearly was statistically significantly associated with time to PCSM and all cause mortality following PSA defined recurrence while undergoing hormonal therapy (Cox p <0.0001). While initial treatment was statistically associated with time to PCSM and all cause mortality (Cox p = 0.001 and 0.01), this association became insignificant when PSA velocity and potential confounding variables were included in the Cox model (p = 0.22 and 0.93, respectively). The adjusted HR for PCSM in patients who experienced a greater than 1.5 ng/ml increase in PSA within 1 year while on hormonal therapy was 239 (95% CI 10 to 5,549). CONCLUSIONS: These data provide evidence to support PSA velocity greater than 1.5 ng/ml yearly as a surrogate end point for PCSM in patients with nonmetastatic, hormone refractory prostate cancer. Enrolling these men onto clinical trials evaluating the impact of chemotherapy on time to bone metastases and PCSM is warranted","","","","","","S0022-5347(05)60625-8 [pii];10.1097/01.ju.0000157569.59229.72 [doi]","Department of Radiation Oncology, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA. adamico@lroc.harvard.edu","PM:15821488","","","",""

Out of 818 treatments performed with a single i.v. dose of 148 MBq of strontium-89 chloride or 1,295 MBq of rhenium-186 hydroxyethylidene diphosphonate (HEDP), 610 could be evaluated (527 with 89Sr and 83 with 186Re-HEDP). Eighty-one patients received multiple (up to five) RTBM. The total number of retreatments was 100. Patients were followed up for a period of 3-24 months. Results, assessed according to pain relief and consumption of analgesic drugs, were expressed at four levels: 1, no response; 2, mild response; 3, good response; 4, excellent response. Responses were: level 1 in 19%, level 2 in 21.3%, level 3 in 33.3% and level 4 in 26.4% of cases. Retreatments showed significantly (P<0.01) worse responses (48% levels 3+4), in comparison to first RTBM. Duration of palliation was 5.0+/-3.5 months, and was longer in cases of excellent response, in first RTBM, in patients with limited metastases and when 89Sr was used. Better responses were found in cases of limited skeletal disease, under good clinical conditions, when life expectancy exceeded 3 months, and in radiologically osteoblastic or mixed bone lesions. The only statistically significant predictive factor was life expectancy (P<0.001). Flare phenomenon (14.1% of cases) did not correlate with the response. Haematological toxicity (mild to moderate in most cases) mainly affected platelets, and was observed in 25.5% of cases overall and in 38.9% of retreatments. RTBM did not seem to prolong life, though in some cases scintigraphic regression of bone metastases was observed. The two radiopharmaceuticals did not show any statistically significant differences in palliative efficacy and toxicity, either in first RTBM or in retreatments","","","","","","","Medicina Nucleare, Universita di Ferrara, Italy","PM:11504074","","","",""

The use of this treatment modality for a number of years in a large population has demonstrated some of its iatrogenic complications, especially bone complications. Hypogonadism induced by chemical castration can be responsible for osteoporosis that may be complicated by fractures. OBJECTIVE: Evaluation of the prevalence of fractures in nonmetastatic sites. PATIENTS AND METHOD: Retrospective study of 49 patients treated for more than 5 years by endocrine therapy with determination of the fracture rate, mechanisms and fracture sites. RESULTS: Eight patients developed fractures after antiandrogen treatment. Three patients with a traumatic or metastatic fracture were excluded. Five patients (10.2%) were considered to present osteoporotic fractures on the basis of their site (vertebra and neck of femur) or their mechanism (minor trauma). The mean duration of treatment in these patients was 8.1 years. The prevalence of osteoporotic fractures in the general population is estimated to be 2.2 per 1,000 men between the ages of 65 and 80 years and 6.4 per 1,000 men after the age of 80 years. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of osteoporosis induced by endocrine therapy is increasing due to longer patient survival and early introduction of treatment. No prophylactic treatment is currently proposed when starting endocrine therapy","","","","","","","Service d'Urologie, Hopital d'Instruction des Armees Sainte Anne, Boulevard Sainte Anne, 83000 Toulon. uroint@hotmail.com","PM:12703357","","","",""

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients with progressive metastatic AIPC were enrolled in an open-label, single-arm phase II study. Sorafenib was given continuously at a dose of 400 mg orally twice daily in 28-day cycles. Clinical assessment and PSA measurement were done every cycle whereas radiographic measurements were carried out every two cycles. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients were enrolled in the study to date, completing a planned first stage of the trial. Baseline patient characteristics included a median age of 63.9 years (range, 50-77 years), Gleason score of 9 (range, 4-9.5), and PSA concentration of 53.3 ng/mL (range, 2-1,905 ng/mL). Fifty-nine percent of patients had received one prior chemotherapy regimen. Of the 21 patients with progressive disease, 13 progressed only by PSA criteria in the absence of evidence of clinical and radiographic progression. Two patients were found to have dramatic reduction of bone metastatic lesions as shown by bone scan, although they met PSA progression criteria at the time when scans were obtained. Toxicities likely related to treatment included one grade 3 hypertension; one grade 3 hand-foot syndrome; and grade 1/2 toxicities: fatigue, anorexia, hypertension, skin rash, nausea, and diarrhea. Results from in vitro studies suggested that PSA is not a good marker of sorafenib activity. The geometric mean exposure (AUC(0-12)) and maximum concentration (C(max)) were 9.76 h mg/L and 1.28 mg/L, respectively. The time to maximum concentration (t(max)) and accumulation ratio (after second dose) ranged from 2 to 12 h and 0.68 to 6.43, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Sorafenib is relatively well tolerated in AIPC with two patients showing evidence of improved bony metastatic lesions. Interpretation of this study is complicated by discordant radiographic and PSA responses. PSA may not be an adequate biomarker for monitoring sorafenib activity. Based on these observations, further investigation using only clinical and radiographic end points as progression criteria is warranted. Accrual to the second stage of trial is ongoing","","","","","","14/1/209 [pii];10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-1355 [doi]","Medical Oncology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA","PM:18172272","","","",""

METHODS: Patients with histologic proof of adenocarcinoma of the prostate progressing despite adequate hormonal therapy and adequate organ function were treated with oral cyclophosphamide, 250 mg/daily (Days 1-14); intravenous vincristine, 1 mg daily (Days 1, 8, 15); and oral dexamethasone, 0.75 mg twice a day (Days 1-14) in 28-day cycles. Study endpoints were toxicity, rate of prostate specific antigen (PSA) decline > 50%, and/or measurable disease response. RESULTS: Fifty-two (95%) of 55 registered patients were evaluable. The majority (65%) of patients had received prior chemotherapy. The median number of treatment cycles given was two (range, one-seven cycles). Twenty-nine percent of the patients were found to have a > 50% decline in PSA level compared with baseline levels, and 25% of the patients with bidimensionally measurable soft-tissue or visceral disease were found to have a partial response. The median progression-free survival duration was 10 weeks, and the median overall survival duration was 10.6 months. There were no thromboembolic events, and hematologic and nonhematologic toxicity was minimal. CONCLUSIONS: CVD was found to be an active and well-tolerated regimen for AI-PCa.

METHODS: We performed an extensive internet search (MEDLINE) using the key words Dickkopf-1 and the abbreviation DKK-1. RESULTS: DKK-1 is a regulator of bone mass with increased expression linked to osteopenia and decreased expression to high bone mass. Moreover, it appears to actively participate in joint remodeling in animal models of arthritis, with increased levels related to bone resorption and decreased levels to new bone formation. Recent studies indicate its possible involvement in the remodeling process of human systemic rheumatic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. DKK-1 may also play a role in osteoarthritis, metabolic bone disease (osteoporosis and Paget's disease), as well as multiple myeloma-associated bone disease and prostate cancer bone metastases. CONCLUSIONS: DKK-1 is a regulator of bone mass and joint remodeling. It may be a promising therapeutic target in osteoporosis; monoclonal antibody-based inhibition of Dkk-1 is already under development for osteoporosis treatment.

This review outlines the basic evidence for use of hormonal therapy while highlighting major research developments made in the past year. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent research on androgen deprivation therapy has suggested that patients with high-risk features may have longer metastasis-free survival with early initiation of androgen deprivation therapy. Fracture risk has been shown to be significantly increased in patients on androgen deprivation therapy and is correlated with duration of treatment. In the treatment of androgen-independent prostate cancer, oral premarin has been shown to induce of prostate specific antigen responses more than 50% in 32% of patients, though thromboembolism remains a risk despite prophylactic low-dose warfarin. Transdermal estradiol has been associated with virtually no cardiovascular toxicity, but induced of prostate specific antigen responses more than 50% in only 12.5% of patients. Clinical studies of nilutamide, flutamide, and ketoconazole have further clarified efficacy of these secondary hormonal treatments. SUMMARY: Optimal timing of androgen deprivation therapy awaits the results of randomized trials, but available evidence indicates that patients with high-risk features may benefit from early androgen deprivation therapy. New estrogen-based therapies have shown promising efficacy in the treatment of androgen-independent prostate cancer, with significantly less cardiovascular toxicity than traditional estrogens","","","","","","10.1097/01.mou.0000193392.77469.e2 [doi];00042307-200605000-00011 [pii]","Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School, 44 Binney Street, Boston, MA 02115, USA","PM:16679855","","","",""

With the diagnosis of prostate cancer being made earlier, the emphasis of treatment has shifted from palliation of symptoms to altering disease-related morbidity and mortality and thus improving overall survival. Treatment of prostate cancer increasingly involves an approach that combines local therapies directed at the primary tumour together with systemic therapies to potentiate their effect and to control subclinical metastatic disease. Patients with localised tumours who are at high risk of relapsing with radiation therapy alone are surviving longer because of the addition of adjuvant hormonal therapy. Although a survival benefit in similar patients undergoing prostatectomy has not yet been established, preliminary results indicate that adjuvant hormonal therapy delays relapse. Chemotherapy is an effective palliative modality for patients with hormone- refractory metastatic disease, and recently completed phase III trials will determine if chemotherapy can prolong survival for this group. The role of chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced tumours is also being investigated in randomised clinical trials. Because bone is the dominant site of metastases for most patients with prostate cancer, the development of therapies that can slow tumour growth specifically within bone is a logical strategy. Bisphosphonates and bone-targeted radionuclides are two such approaches that have shown encouraging results even in the most advanced stages of the disease. Although one can now reasonably hypothesise that survival has improved because of recent therapeutic advances, it remains to be conclusively established that cytotoxic or other systemic therapy can extend survival of patients with prostate cancer. Only the results of ongoing randomised trials can definitely establish that more patients with locally advanced and metastatic prostate cancer are living longer","","","","","","2095 [pii]","Department of Medical Oncology, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19111, USA","PM:12831292","","","",""

All men received nilutamide 150 mg/day orally for > or = 8 weeks unless there was unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. All men were evaluated for response, safety and toxicity. Baseline PSA levels, chest X-ray, bone scan and abdominopelvic computed tomography studies were obtained; the re-evaluation included PSA levels every 4 weeks and repeated imaging every 8 weeks in those with baseline abnormalities. The chest X-ray was repeated if there were pulmonary symptoms. Nineteen men were consented and 16 were evaluable for response.

In a Phase II trial in patients with pain-free or mildly symptomatic metastatic HRPC, zibotentan was well tolerated with a promising signal for prolonged overall survival compared with placebo. As part of this trial, the impact of zibotentan compared with placebo on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was assessed. Methods: Patients were randomized to receive once-daily oral zibotentan 10 or 15 mg, or matching placebo. Patients were allocated to one of two questionnaires; the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P) or the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30), supplemented by PR25, specific for prostate cancer. Questionnaires were completed at baseline and every 4 weeks until disease progression when study treatment was discontinued. Results: Compliance with questionnaire completion was & gt;90% (286 of 312 patients) of the intention-to-treat population at baseline. Of baseline completers who were available for assessment (i.e., had not clinically progressed), 89% (164 of 184) and 83% (73 of 88) completed questionnaires at 12 and 24 weeks, respectively. HRQoL scores from both questionnaires were high at baseline and remained high throughout the study, with scores being similar in the zibotentan and placebo groups. However, some floor and ceiling effects were seen in the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire. Conclusions: High-baseline HRQoL scores were maintained throughout treatment with zibotentan. The FACT-P instrument was selected to further assess the impact of zibotentan on HRQoL in the Phase III clinical trial program. (c) 2010 Springer-Verlag","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This treatment clearly demonstrated a survival benefit, but never a cure. With the ever-expanding understanding of the pathophysiology of prostate cancer, there has been a recent explosion in the potential molecular targets and novel therapeutic approaches to both advanced and potentially localized prostate cancer. This review will focus on what the author perceives to be the most promising of these new strategies. The endothelin pathway has been identified as pivotal in the viscous cycle of tumorigenesis in bone, leading to the development of endothelial receptor antagonists. Vaccine therapy using autologous granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor-producing prostate cancer cells has been effective in producing both immune and clinical responses. Randomized clinical trials of the immunotherapy cell product APC8015 (Provenge) have demonstrated improved survival in the hormone-refractory setting. The development of antisense oligonucleotides to segments of mRNA critical to the progression to androgen-independent disease has emerged as one further tool in the expanding armamentarium of potential therapies being tested. Clearly, headway is being made in improving outcomes in this most prevalent health problem","","","","","","10.1586/14737140.6.7.993 [doi]","Marlene and Stewart Greenebaum Cancer Center, University of Maryland, 22 South Greene Street, Baltimore, MD 21201-1595, USA. ndawson@umm.edu","PM:16831072","","","",""

It is therefore important to provide cancer patients with programmes to support the return-to-work process. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of interventions aimed at enhancing return-to-work in cancer patients. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, in The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2010), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, OSH-ROM, PsycINFO, DARE, ClinicalTrials.gov, Trialregister.nl and Controlled-trials.com to February 2010, reference lists of included articles and selected reviews, and contacted authors of relevant articles. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled before-after studies (CBAs) of the effectiveness of psychological, vocational, physical, medical or multidisciplinary interventions enhancing return-to-work in cancer patients. The primary outcome was return-to-work measured as either return-to-work rate or sick leave duration. Secondary outcome was quality of life. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently selected trials, assessed the risk of bias and extracted data. We pooled studies with sufficient data, judged to be clinically homogeneous in different comparisons. We assessed the overall quality of the evidence for each comparison using the GRADE approach. MAIN RESULTS: Fourteen articles reporting 14 RCTs and 4 CBAs were included. These studies involved a total of 1652 participants. Results indicated low quality evidence of similar return-to-work rates for psychological interventions compared to care as usual (odds ratio (OR) = 2.32, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.94 to 5.71). No vocational interventions were retrieved. Very low evidence suggested that physical training was not more effective than care as usual on improving return-to-work (OR = 1.20, 95% CI 0.32 to 4.54). Eight RCTs on medical interventions showed low quality evidence that functioning conserving approaches had similar return-to-work rates as more radical treatments (OR = 1.53, 95% CI 0.95 to 2.45). Moderate quality evidence showed multidisciplinary interventions involving physical, psychological and vocational components led to higher return-to-work rates than care as usual (OR = 1.87, 95% CI 1.07 to 3.27). No differences in the effect of psychological, physical, medical or multidisciplinary interventions compared to care as usual were found on quality of life outcomes. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Moderate quality evidence showed that employed patients with cancer experience return-to-work benefits from multidisciplinary interventions compared to care as usual. More high quality RCTs aimed at enhancing return-to-work in cancer patients are needed. INTERVENTIONS TO ENHANCE RETURN-TO-WORK FOR CANCER PATIENTS: Each year cancer survival rates are going up and the number of cancer survivors is rising sharply. Many survivors are doing well, although cancer survivors can continue to experience long-lasting problems such as fatigue, pain, and depression which may become chronic. These long-term effects can clearly cause problems with work participation of cancer survivors. Therefore, cancer is a significant cause of absence from work, unemployment and early retirement. Individuals, their families and society at large all carry part of the burden.This review evaluated the effects of interventions aimed at enhancing return-to-work in cancer patients. It included 18 studies involving 1652 participants. Four types of interventions were found: psychological interventions, interventions aimed at physical functioning, medical interventions, and multidisciplinary interventions which incorporated physical, psychological and vocational components. No vocational interventions aimed at work-related issues were retrieved. Results suggest that multidisciplinary interventions involving physical, psychological and vocational components led to higher return-to-work rates of cancer patients than care as usual, while quality of life was similar","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Especially for locally advanced tumors radiotherapy +/- adjuvant androgen deprivation treatment is standard of care. This brings up the need for accurate assessment of extra prostatic tumor growth and/or the presence of nodal metastases for selection of the optimal radiation dose and treatment volume. Morphological imaging like transrectal ultra sound, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are routinely used but are limited in their accuracy in detecting extra prostatic extension and nodal metastases. In this article we present a structured review of the literature on positron emission tomography (PET)/CT and radiotherapy in prostate cancer patients with emphasis on: 1) the pretreatment assessment of extra prostatic tumor extension, nodal and distant metastases; 2) the intraprostatic tumor characterization and radiotherapy treatment planning; and 3) treatment evaluation and the use of PET/CT in guidance of salvage treatment. PET/CT is not an appropriate imaging technique for accurate T-staging of prostate cancer prior to radiotherapy. Although macroscopic disease beyond the prostatic capsule and into the periprostatic fat or in seminal vesicle is often accurately detected, the microscopic extension of prostate cancer remains undetected. Choline PET/CT holds a great potential as a single step diagnostic procedure of lymph nodes and skeleton, which could facilitate radiotherapy treatment planning. At present the use of PET/CT for treatment planning in radiotherapy is still experimental. Choline PET based tumor delineation is not yet standardized and different segmentation-algorithms are under study. However, dose escalation using dose-painting is feasible with only limited increases of the doses to the bladder and rectum wall. PET/CT using either acetate or choline is able to detect recurrent prostate cancer after radiotherapy but stratification of patients for any local salvage treatment has not been addressed in the current literature","","","","","","R39102288 [pii]","Department of Urology, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands. i.j.de.jong@uro.umcg.nl","PM:20927021","","","",""

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between October 1997 and June 1999, 35 patients underwent cryoablation of the prostate (19 after radiation therapy failure and 16 as a primary treatment for localized prostate cancer). All patients had biopsy-confirmed prostate cancer with no seminal vesicle invasion, negative bone scans and a negative lymph node dissection. Patients received 3 months of combined hormonal therapy before cryosurgery. One surgeon performed all the procedures. Biochemical recurrence was defined by an increase in prostate specific antigen (PSA) of >/= 0.2 ng/mL above the PSA nadir. RESULTS: The complications were rectal pain (26%), urinary infection (3%), scrotal oedema (12%), haematuria (6%) and incontinence (6%). Complication rates were higher in those patients who failed after radiation therapy than in those who did not receive radiation (incontinence 11% vs 0%, rectal pain 37% vs 12%) but the difference was not statistically significant. Twenty-two patients (63%) had an undetectable serum PSA nadir (< 0.1 ng/mL) after cryotherapy and 30 (84%) patients had a PSA value of < 1.0 ng/mL. After a mean follow-up of 8.3 months (range 0.2-18), nine patients had biochemical recurrence. The biochemical recurrence-free survival (BRFS) was 70% at 9 months. Patients who had an undetectable PSA nadir had a statistically higher BRSF at 9 months than did patients who had a detectable PSA nadir (89% vs 55%, respectively, P = 0.03). Similarly, patients with a preoperative serum PSA level of < 10 ng/mL had a statistically higher BRFS than patients who had a PSA level of > 10 ng/mL (86% vs 42% at 9 months, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: A PSA level before cryotherapy of < 10 ng/mL and an undetectable PSA nadir after cryotherapy were associated with the highest BRFS. Cryoablation of the prostate, with low morbidity, seems to be a viable option in managing patients by salvage therapy after radiation therapy and for the primary treatment of clinically localized prostate cancer","","","","","","bju456 [pii]","Department of Urology and Department of Biostatistics, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, USA","PM:10671882","","","",""

The aim of treatment is to prevent disease-related morbidity and mortality while minimizing intervention-related adverse events. Androgen suppression therapy (AST) to reduce circulating serum testosterone and disease progression is considered a mainstay of treatment for men with advanced prostate cancer. It has been increasingly utilized for early stage disease despite a lack of evidence of effectiveness. OBJECTIVES: Evaluate the effectiveness and safety of intermittent androgen suppression (IAS) compared to continuous androgen suppression for treating prostatic cancer. SEARCH STRATEGY: The following databases were searched to identify randomised or quasi-randomised, controlled trials comparing intermittent and continuous androgen suppression in the treatment of any stage of prostate cancer: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials; EMBASE and LILACS. SELECTION CRITERIA: Studies were included if they were randomised or quasi-randomized, and compare the effects of IAS versus CAS. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers selected relevant trials, assessed methodological quality and extracted data. MAIN RESULTS: Five randomized studies involving 1382 patients were included in this review. All the included studies involved advanced (T3 or T4) prostate cancer, had relatively small populations, and were of short duration. Few events were reported and did not assess disease-specific survival or metastatic disease. Only one study (N = 77) evaluated biochemical outcomes. A subgroup analysis found no significant differences in biochemical progression (defined by the authors as PSA &#8805; 10 ng/mL) between IAS and CAS for Gleason scores 4 - 6, 7, and 8 - 10. For patients with a Gleason score > 6, reduction in biochemical progression favoured the IAS group (RR 0.10, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.67, P = 0.02). Studies primarily reported on adverse events. One trial (N = 43) found no difference in adverse effects (gastrointestinal, gynecomastia and asthenia) between IAS ( two events) and CAS (five events), with the exception of impotence, which was significantly lower in the IAS group (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.92, P = 0.008). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Data from RCTs comparing IAS to CAS are limited by small sample size and short duration. There are no data for the relative effectiveness of IAS versus CAS for overall survival, prostate cancer-specific survival, or disease progression. Limited information suggests IAS may have slightly reduced adverse events. Overall, IAS was also as effective as CAS for potency, but was superior during the interval of cycles (96%). TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS AND SAFETY OF INTERMITTENT ANDROGEN SUPPRESSION COMPARED TO CONTINUOUS ANDROGEN SUPPRESSION FOR TREATING PROSTATIC CANCER.: After lung cancer, prostate cancer is the most common cause of death among males. The American Cancer Society estimates that 234,460 new cases of prostate cancer were diagnosed, and 27,350 men died from this disease in the United States in 2006 (ACS 2006). Treatment for early stage prostate cancer that is believed to be confined to the prostate gland include: radical prostatectomy, external beam or interstitial radiation therapy, and watchful waiting. Androgen suppression therapy (AST) to reduce circulating serum testosterone and disease progression is considered a mainstay of treatment for men with advanced prostate cancer.Five studies involving 1382 patients were included in this review. All the included studies involved advanced (T3 or T4) prostate cancer. No study was of adequate size and duration. Few events were reported and they did not assess disease-specific survival or metastatic disease. Only one study evaluated biochemical outcomes. Studies primarily reported on adverse events. There are no data for the relative effectiveness of IAS versus CAS for overall survival, prostate cancer specific survival, disease progression, or quality of life. Limited information suggests IAS may have slightly reduced adverse events. In Hering 2000, IAS (18/25 versus 18/18) appears to be slightly more favorable than CAS in controlling impotence. Overall, IAS was also as effective as CAS for potency, but was superior during the interval of cycles (96%). More research is needed","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The conflicting results could be explained by the fact that patients were included with different prognostic factors. In this new analysis of the Anandron European Study, independent prognostic factors have been evaluated in order to identify those which could influence the study outcome and the impact of the treatment. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 399 out of 457 patients recruited in this study were divided in a good or poor prognostic group depending on the presence of two or more poor prognostic factors, these were pain requiring treatment, >5 bone metastases, hydronephrosis, and alkaline phosphatase >2 ULN. RESULTS: When expressed as a percentage, the improvement in time to progression, overall and cancer specific survival in the Anandron treated patients was identical in both groups. In absolute terms this improvement, however, was greater in the good prognostic group.

Focus was put on bone-targeted treatment, chemotherapy for second line use, combinations of standard chemotherapy with different new drugs and data on a novel antiangiogenic compounds. Denosumab was shown to be superior to zoledronic acid in the treatment of patients with bone me tastases of CRPC. Cabazitaxel improved survival in CRPC patients who progressed during or after docetaxel. This substance might become the first standard treatment for second line use. There are still concerns about the dose and toxicity. Both new drugs still need to be approved but will change our practice in the management of bone metastases and in the second line setting and enlarge significantly our small armamentarium of medical treatment of CRPC. So far, there is no proven benefit in adding any drug to standard docetaxel. This fact was confirmed by final data analyses of the combination of docetaxel with bevacizumab or calcitriol. Tasquinimod is a promising novel anti-angiogenic compound that delayed disease progression significantly in asymptomatic CRPC patients. A phase III-trial will reveal the true value of this compound. In conclusion, in the 2010 ASCO meeting, valuable new information concerning the medical treatment of CRPC was conveyed which might indeed change our clinical practice.

Bisphosphonates reduce excessive bone turnover while preserving bone structure and mineralization in patients with other tumor types. We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial to determine whether the first-generation bisphosphonate sodium clodronate could improve bone progression-free survival (BPFS) times among men with bone metastases from prostate cancer. METHODS: Between June 1994 and July 1998, 311 men who were starting or responding to first-line hormone therapy for bone metastases were randomly assigned to receive oral sodium clodronate (2080 mg/day) or placebo for a maximum of 3 years. The primary endpoint of the trial was symptomatic BPFS. Secondary endpoints included overall survival, treatment toxicity, and change in World Health Organization (WHO) performance status. Time-to-event data were analyzed using the log-rank chi-square test and Kaplan-Meier curves. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were balanced across the two groups. After a median follow-up of 59 months, the sodium clodronate group showed statistically nonsignificant better symptomatic BPFS (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.79, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.61 to 1.02; P =.066) and overall survival (HR = 0.80, 95% CI = 0.62 to 1.03; P =.082) than the control group. Patients in the clodronate group were less likely to have a worsened WHO performance status (HR = 0.71, 95% CI = 0.56 to 0.92; P =.008). However, the clodronate group reported more gastrointestinal problems and increased lactate dehydrogenase levels and required more frequent modification of the trial drug dose (HR for any adverse event = 1.71, 95% CI = 1.21 to 2.41; P =.002). Results of subgroup analyses suggested that clodronate might be more effective the sooner after diagnosis of metastatic bone disease it is started. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that further studies of the effect of newer generation bisphosphonates on BPFS in men with metastatic prostate cancer are warranted","","","","","","","Institute of Cancer Research and Royal Marsden Hospital, Sutton, UK","PM:12953084","","","",""

The Medical Research Council (MRC) PR05 and PR04 randomised controlled trials assessed the use of sodium clodronate, an oral, first-generation bisphosphonate. We report the final analyses of long-term survival data with additional follow-up in both trials. METHODS: 311 men with metastatic disease were recruited to PR05 between 1994 and 1998, and 508 men with non-metastatic disease were recruited to PR04 from 1994 to 1997. All men were treated according to the recruiting site's standard practice at the time: for metastatic disease, all men were starting or responding to long-term hormone therapy; for non-metastatic disease, most men had radiotherapy, hormone therapy, or both. Men were randomly assigned to take four tablets per day of sodium clodronate (2080 mg) or matching placebo for up to 3 years (metastatic disease) or 5 years (non-metastatic). Long-term overall survival was assessed on an intention-to-treat basis in all men at sites in England and Wales using data from the National Health Service Information Centre, which held data for 278 of 311 men in the PR05 trial and 471 of 508 men in the PR04 trial.

Of the 471 men with non-metastatic disease, 281 (60%) were reported to have died, with no evidence of improvement in overall survival with clodronate compared with placebo (HR 1.12, 0.89-1.42; p=0.94). INTERPRETATION: Long-term data from these trials show that a first-generation bisphosphonate, sodium clodronate, improves overall survival in men with metastatic prostate cancer who are starting hormone therapy, but there is no evidence of an effect in men with non-metastatic prostate cancer.

Abarelix, a gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist, with its indication for advanced symptomatic prostate cancer, represents the newest category of hormonal therapy introduced in the past 15 years. Results from Phase II and III clinical trials demonstrate the advantages of abarelix over commonly used luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist therapy: abarelix does not cause a surge in serum testosterone that can precipitate a flare phenomenon or worsening of disease, particularly dangerous for patients with metastatic, symptomatic disease, and produces medical castration more quickly. Abarelix was also demonstrated to promptly and substantially reduce follicle-stimulating hormone levels to lower than LHRH agonist. Study results demonstrate effective anticancer responses during extended exposure to abarelix: improvements in pain score and/or analgesic use, improvements in urinary symptoms (including urinary catheter removal) and complete avoidance of bilateral orchiectomy for patients undergoing at least 12 weeks of treatment. In Phase III clinical trials, abarelix demonstrated a similar overall safety profile when compared with LHRH agonist monotherapy, and a superior safety profile when compared with LHRH agonist plus antiandrogen combination therapy. Abarelix patients experienced a greater incidence of immediate-onset systemic allergic reactions as compared with control arms. (c) 2006 Future Medicine Ltd","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We sought to quantify the longitudinal effects on patient-reported outcomes of skeletal-related events (SREs) and to ascertain the declines in health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and pain experienced by patients who experienced SREs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data are from a clinical trial for the treatment of SREs associated with advanced prostate cancer metastatic to bone. Outcome measures included the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G) and the Brief Pain Inventory. Among patients who survived 6 months after randomization, patients with no SREs in the initial 6 months after randomization were matched via propensity scores with those experiencing one or more SREs. Similarly, patients with one SRE were matched with a subset of patients with two or more SREs. MAIN RESULTS: Patients with SREs in the initial period had significantly worse survival and HRQOL than those with no SREs. Significant differences were found between the pain differences, FACT-G total scores, and FACT-G physical, emotional, and functional subscales. Comparisons of patients with single vs multiple SREs showed similar patterns. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of SREs is significantly associated with worse survival and poorer HRQOL in this patient population. Increasing SRE intensity shows a pattern of increasingly decreased survival and poorer HRQOL","","","","","","10.1007/s00520-006-0203-x [doi]","Center for Clinical and Genetic Economics, Duke Clinical Research Institute, Duke University Medical Center, P.O.

Ten-color flow cytometry was used to analyze IL-17-producing CD4(+) T-cells in the peripheral blood of hormone-resistant non-bone metastatic prostate cancer patients prior to immunotherapy with an allogeneic whole-cell vaccine. Surface expression of the chemokine receptors CCR4 and CCR6 was used to further subdivide IL-17-producing cells into subsets with distinct homing properties. The frequency of circulating regulatory T-cells (Tregs), defined as CD3(+)CD4(+)CD127(lo)Foxp3(+)CD25(+) was compared in the same patients. The frequency of CCR4(-)IL-17(+)CD4(+) T-cells prevaccination inversely correlated with time to disease progression (TTP) in 23 prostate cancer patients. Furthermore, responder (R) patients with statistically significant reductions in PSA velocity (PSAV) in response to the immunotherapy (n = 9), showed a Th17 profile similar to healthy male controls and significantly different from non-responder (NR) patients (n = 14) (i.e., those without any significant reduction in PSAV). In contrast, the frequency of Tregs in peripheral blood in PSA-R (n = 11) and -NR (n = 14) patients was similar (but in both cases, significantly higher than in age-matched healthy men). Accordingly, there was no significant correlation between frequency of Tregs and TTP in these late-stage prostate cancer patients undergoing active immunotherapy. These data imply an important role for IL-17-producing helper T-cells in cancer immunology and highlight their potential use as a pretreatment screen to ensure appropriate treatment is offered to hormone-resistant prostate cancer patients","","","","","","10.1002/ijc.24497 [doi]","Department of Internal Medicine II, Center for Medical Research, University of Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany. evelyna.derhovanessian@klinikum.uni-tuebingen.de","PM:19533748","","","",""

Natural history of prostate cancer extends on 10 to 15 years. As shown by randomized trials on screening, PSA measurements lead to early detection of localised cancer and explain the decrease number of metastatic disease which remains frequent in the elderly. However, patients with bone metastasis present painful symptomatology and a poor quality of life. This disease is hormone-sensitive during 18 to 24 months, before it becomes androgen-resistant. Considering epidemiologic and life expectancy data, we can expect an increasing number of patients with an hormonal blocking and it is important to develop alternative treatments to improve the prognosis of this disease which remains poor at the metastatic stage.

In several well designed trials, zoledronic acid 4 mg administered as a 15-minute infusion every 3-4 weeks was effective in reducing the occurrence of skeletal complications in patients with bone metastases secondary to multiple myeloma, breast cancer or prostate cancer. Zoledronic acid was as effective as pamidronic acid in reducing the occurrence of skeletal complications in patients with multiple myeloma or breast cancer. In patients with solid tumours other than breast or prostate cancer, zoledronic acid did not show significant clinical benefit over placebo in terms of the primary endpoint; however, some benefit of therapy in terms of secondary endpoints was observed with zoledronic acid relative to placebo. Its efficacy in a broad range of tumours and short infusion time (15 minutes) are an advantage over other available bisphosphonates. Modelled pharmacoeconomic analyses in patients with breast cancer suggested that zoledronic acid therapy is cost effective relative to no therapy with regard to the cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained; however, results were mixed when zoledronic acid was compared with other commonly used bisphosphonates. Zoledronic acid is generally well tolerated; the risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw may be minimized by adhering to recommendations regarding dental therapy. Additional efficacy and economic data are required to definitively position zoledronic acid with respect to other bisphosphonates. Nevertheless, available clinical data indicate that zoledronic acid is an effective treatment option for the management of bone metastases of malignancy","","","","","","68410 [pii]","Wolters Kluwer Health Adis, Auckland, New Zealand. demail@adis.co.nz","PM:18318568","","","",""

Most of the patients develop hormone-refractory disease resulting in progressive clinical deterioration and, ultimately, death. Until recently there has been no standard chemotherapeutic approach for hormone refractory prostate cancer (HRPC), the major benefits of chemotherapy being only palliative. The studies combining mitoxantrone plus a corticosteroid demonstrated that chemotherapy could be given to men with symptomatic HRPC with minimal toxicity and a significant palliation could be provided. Recently, results from 2 phase III randomized clinical trials demonstrating that a combination of docetaxel plus prednisone can improve survival in men with HRPC have propelled docetaxel-based therapy into the forefront of treatment options for these patients as the new standard of care. There is a promising activity of new drug combinations such as taxanes plus vinca alkaloids; bisphosphonates are assuming a prominent role in prostate therapy through their ability to prevent skeletal morbidity. Combinations of classic chemotherapeutic agents and biological drugs began to be tested in phase II-III trials and the first results appear interesting. This article focuses on combinations recently evaluated or under clinical development for the treatment of HRPC","","","","","","3 [pii]","Dipartimento di Endocrinologia Molecolare e Clinica, Cattedra di Oncologia, Universita degli Studi di Napoli Federico II, Via Pansini 5, 80131 Naples, Italy. giuseppedilorenzoncol@hotmail.com","PM:16569343","","","",""

The current study investigated the combination of docetaxel, vinorelbine, and zoledronic acid as a first-line treatment for HRPC. METHODS: Patients were treated repeatedly with docetaxel (25 mg/mq) and vinorelbine (10 mg/mq) intravenously for three consecutive weeks followed by a 1-wk rest until disease progression or side effects. Zoledronic acid was administered every 4 wk. Changes in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels and objective responses were evaluated after two and three cycles, respectively. Toxicity and pain evaluation, based on pain intensity reduction and analgesic drug reduction, were assessed every cycle. RESULTS: Forty men with HRPC (median age: 65 yr) were treated. Among 38 evaluable patients, complete and major PSA responses were observed in seven (18%) and 12 (32%), respectively; a partial objective response was observed in six of 15 (40%) patients with measurable disease. Neutropenia (25%) was the most important grade 3 haematologic toxicity observed. Only three patients (7.5%) reported grade 4 neutropenia. Nineteen patients (47.5%) achieved a reduction of pain intensity and analgesic drug use after two cycles. Median progression-free survival was 7 mo (95% CI: 2-10 mo), with a median overall survival of 17 mo (95% CI: 6-22 mo).

No agents are approved for second-line therapy in HRPC, but common standard practice for the oncologists is to treat patients also after docetaxel failure. METHODS: Twenty highly pretreated patients with HRPC received bevacizumab (10mg/kg) and docetaxel (60mg/m(2)) every 3 wk. All patients had bone metastases and eight had measurable lesions. RESULTS: Eleven patients (55%) had major prostate-specific antigen (PSA) responses, and 3 (37.5%) had objective responses. Seven major PSA responses were recorded in the same patients who had reported a >50% PSA decrease after first-line docetaxel. However, four major PSA responses were observed in patients previously nonresponsive to docetaxel alone. The treatment was well tolerated.

In recent years, several new agents with promising activity and a favourable toxicity profile have been developed and clinically investigated in the fields of hormonal, cytotoxic, targeted and immune therapy. In particular, recent results from two large phase III trials of sipuleucel-T and cabazitaxel show that these two agents significantly prolong overall survival in CRPC. Indeed, sipuleucel-T has recently been approved by the US FDA for the treatment of CRPC. Many other pharmaceuticals, which are presented in this review, have been investigated recently or are being investigated in phase III trials and might prove to be effective in the future. Re viewed articles are discussed in light of the innovations in study design brought by the Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group (PCWG2), which updated the Prostate-Specific Antigen Working Group (PCWG1) guidelines, in order to allow better identification of potentially active drugs in clinical trials.

PATIENTS AND METHODS Between November 2005 and January 2009, 45 patients initially responding to docetaxel and then experiencing disease progression after a period of biochemical remission of at least 5 months were enrolled in a prospective multicenter study and re-treated with doce taxel. The primary endpoint was the biochemical response (biochemical partial response defined as >50% prostate-specific antigen [PSA] decline); secondary endpoints were objective response, toxicity, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). RESULTS Partial PSA responses were observed in 11 patients (24.5%), 4 (25%) of whom also had an objective response. The treatment was well tolerated, with grade 1-2 neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, vomiting and peripheral neuropathy noted in 18 (40%), 11 (24.5%), 8 (17.8%), and 6 (13.3%) patients, respectively. The most common grade 3 toxicity was neutropenia, which was observed in 8 patients (17.8%). Median PFS was 5 months and median OS was 13 months. CONCLUSIONS Docetaxel re-treatme nt preserves anti-tumour activity and is well tolerated in a selected population of pretreated patients with CRPC. Further randomized trials are needed to confirm our preliminary results. (c) 2010 BJU INTERNATIONAL","","","","","","","","","","","",""

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten patients with stage D3 disease and bone metastases who had progression despite initial responses to combined androgen blockade and in whom antiandrogen withdrawal subsequently failed discontinued combined androgen blockade and received 1 mg ethinylestradiol orally daily and 73.9 mg lanreotide acetate intramuscularly every 4 weeks. Serum prostate specific antigen (PSA), chromogranin A (CgA), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status and bone pain scores were assessed at regular intervals. Median followup was 18 months (range 10 to 24). RESULTS: Nine of the 10 cases (90%, 95% CI 55.5 to 99.8) had an objective clinical response, defined as a greater than 50% PSA decrease (median 87.1%, range 50.2% to 94.4%). PSA normalization (less than 4 ng/ml) was achieved in 3 cases. All patients reported significant and durable improvement in bone pain (median duration 17.5 months) and performance status (median duration 18 months) without major treatment related side effects. Two patients with disease progression died secondary to PC at 16 and 10 months, respectively. All other patients were without progression. We observed a statistically significant decrease in serum CgA during administration and at the response to therapy (median 38.4%, range 28.6% to 64.9%, (p <0.0001). Interestingly CgA was not increased at relapse.

This study was undertaken to evaluate the antiosteoporotic efficacy of intravenous pamidronate in a double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study. METHODS: Twenty-one consecutive men with metastatic prostate carcinoma who were receiving combined androgen blockade with a long-acting gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (gosarelin acetate) and an androgen antagonist (flutamide or bicalutamide) were evaluated at baseline and at 6 and 12 months after therapy. They were randomly assigned to receive a single intravenous infusion of 500 mL of normal saline solution diluted with either pamidronate (90 mg) or placebo at baseline and with a crossover at 6 months. Lumbar-spine bone-mineral densities (BMDs) were measured by spinal quantitative computed tomography (QCT), femoral neck BMDs were measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and markers of bone turnover were measured by noninvasive methods. Data on 10 men with localized prostate carcinoma who were treated with radiotherapy alone, over the same period, was collected for comparison studies. RESULTS: The mean age of the men was 75.1 years +/- 1.6 years. One man withdrew from the study because of deteriorating health, and two died from metastatic disease within the first 6 months. Combined androgen blockade normalized serum prostate-specific antigen activities (from an initial mean value of 86.2 ng/mL +/- 10.1 ng/mL) and maintained serum free testosterone concentrations in the hypogonadal range (< 2.2 pmol/L) in all men throughout the study. Treatment with pamidronate resulted in a 7.8% +/- 1.5% increase in mean lumbar spine QCT from 79.4 mg/cm(3) (95% confidence interval [CI], 64-94 mg/cm(3)) to 85.6 mg/cm(3) (95% CI, 70-101 mg/cm(3)) (P = 0.0005) and a 2% +/- 0.9% increase in mean total femoral neck DXA from 0.98 g/cm(2) (95% CI, 0.90 -1.05 g/cm(2)) to 1.0 mg/cm(2) (95% CI, 0.91-1.08 g/cm(2)) (P = 0.02). Conversely, treatment with placebo, resulted in a 5.7% +/- 1.6% decrease in mean lumbar spine QCT and a 2.3% +/- 0.7% decrease in mean total femoral neck DXA (P = 0.0001 and P = 0.0007 for the comparison of percentage change between the pamidronate and placebo treatments). After pamidronate therapy, serum bone Gla-protein concentrations decreased by 16.8% +/- 5.9%, and urinary deoxypyridinoline excretion rates decreased by 18.5% +/- 12.8% (P < 0.01 respectively for the comparison between pamidronate and placebo treatment). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that a single intravenous infusion of pamidronate (90 mg) significantly reduced the high bone turnover and bone loss (for at least 6 mos) in men with prostate carcinoma who had been rendered hypogonadal with combined androgen blockade therapy","","","","","","10.1002/1097-0142(20010915)92:6<1444::AID-CNCR1468>3.0.CO;2-M [pii]","Metabolic Bone Unit, St. George Hospital, Kogarah, Sydney, Australia","PM:11745221","","","",""

The aims of this study were to evaluate the expression and clinical significance of this enzyme in the primary tumors of prostate cancer patients with bone metastasis who were scheduled to receive antiandrogenic therapy. This study was prospectively performed in 28 stage D2 prostate cancer patients who, after diagnosis, received maximum androgen blockade. Pepsinogen C tumor expression was analyzed in samples (24 from needle biopsy cylinders and four from transurethral resection specimens) from primary tumors using an immunohistochemical assay. Twelve prostate carcinomas (42.8%) were positive for pepsinogen C. Pepsinogen C was a significant prognostic factor to predict a longer overall survival in the patients of our study (p<0.01).

In the advanced setting, the treatment goal is essentially palliative. Hormonal treatment represents the main therapeutic approach for those patients. However, the disease usually becomes resistant to hormonal manipulation after several months. The anti-microtubular agent docetaxel has shown significant clinical activity in hormonal-refractory patients that has translated in better symptomatic control and also in a survival benefit. In this context, many molecular targeted therapies are being investigated in an attempt to improve the outcome of the disease, including signal transduction inhibitors, proapoptotic theraples, antiangiogenics, cell-differentiation modulating agents, and immunologic strategies among others.

HRPC presents a challenging therapeutic problem. Salvage chemotherapy is the usual approach at this stage of the disease. The combination of a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analog with a somatostatin analog and dexamethasone has produced objective clinical responses in HRPC. METHODS: Forty patients with HRPC were randomized to receive one of two treatments. Group 1 underwent chemotherapy (estramustine 140 mg three times daily and etoposide 100 mg orally for 21 days) and group 2 the combination of a somatostatin analog (lanreotide 30 mg intramuscularly every 14 days) and dexamethasone (4 mg tapered to 1 mg), in addition to androgen ablation by orchiectomy or a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analog (triptorelin 3.75 mg intramuscularly every 28 days). The clinical and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response, overall survival, time to progression, and toxicity were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: The data of 20 patients in group 1 and 18 in group 2 were analyzed. The demographic and clinical data were similar in the two groups at study entry. A PSA response (decrease of greater than 50%) was observed in 45% of group 1 and 44% of group 2. The difference was not statistically significant. A partial clinical response was observed in 29% and 30% of groups 1 and 2, respectively. Again, the difference was not statistically significant. Changes in performance status and pain score during treatment were not significantly different in the two groups. Hematologic toxicity was more frequent in group 1 (80% of patients), and mild diabetes was more frequent in group 2 (22% of patients). The overall survival was 18.8 months in group 1 and 18 months in group 2 (not statistically significant). The time to progression was 6 versus 4 months and, in the PSA responder subgroup, it was 8 versus 7.7 months in groups 1 and 2, respectively (neither difference was statistically significant). CONCLUSIONS: The results of our randomized Phase II study indicated that the new combination treatment (luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analog, somatostatin analog, and dexamethasone) may be equally effective as salvage chemotherapy in patients with HRPC in terms of the clinical and PSA response, overall survival, and time to progression. A larger prospective Phase III trial is required to confirm our observations","","","","","","S0090429503009336 [pii]","Department of Clinical Therapeutics, University of Athens School of Medicine, Athens, Greece","PM:14751362","","","",""

Studies of systemic therapy before and after local therapy are vitally important to determine whether early systemic interventions might delay cancer progression. Chemotherapy must be studied in earlier disease progression. Novel targeted therapies, such as vaccine therapy, angiogenesis inhibitors, and newer microtubule targeting agents, should be studied in all stages of progression. Despite these needs and the availability of systemic therapies, accrual to trials has been lagging. This article reviews the national cooperative group clinical trials, whether currently open or planned, and suggests practical strategies to improve accrual.

The variations and reproducibility in the estimated absorbed dose owing to the reconstruction algorithm used (OSEM vs. FBP) were also analysed. For this aim, correction methods for scatter and attenuation were kept identical, whereas the same calibration data and thresholding techniques were used to obtain quantification. This study was carried out in spinal and pelvic lesions of 7 patients. For comparison, the absorbed doses, based upon the maximum and the mean voxel count, were calculated, resulting in the absorbed dose (maximum): 60 Gy (sigma = 30 Gy) and 33 Gy (sigma = 15 Gy) for OSEM and FBP, respectively, and absorbed dose (mean): 26 Gy (sigma = 12 Gy) and 17 Gy (sigma = 7 Gy) with OSEM and FBP, respectively. We concluded that the administration of fixed activity resulted in a range of absorbed doses, and we showed that, despite using the same approach, the choice of the reconstruction algorithm can result in differences higher than 50% in the estimated tumor-absorbed doses. In conclusion, the need for a standardization of the methodology used for the calculations is emphasized by this work, especially when comparisons between patients and different centers are of interest","","","","","","10.1089/cbr.2007.303 [doi]","Joint Department of Physics, Institute of Cancer Research and Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, Sulton, Surrey, UK. antigoni.divoli@icr.ac.uk","PM:17627420","","","",""

Most patients with bone metastases complain of bone pains. This pain may be alleviated or eliminated by administration of radiotherapy at the site of metastases. Currently, two forms of radiotherapy administration exist: external-beam irradiation or intravenous administration of bone-seeking therapeutic radiopharmacon such as samarium-153-ethylene-diamino-tetramethylene-phosphonate (EDTMP). This radiopharmacon produces beta-particles and concentrates in the areas of enhanced osteoblastic activity. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of (153)Sm-EDTMP therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 32 men (aged 50-83, mean 70 years) with bone disseminated hormone-refractory prostate cancer and bone pain received (153)Sm-EDTMP. Mean applied dosage was 40 MBq/kg of the patient's body weight. Karnofsky performance status, pain score (numerical rating scale), analgesic score (WHO) and blood count were evaluated before, and 1 and 3 months after the treatment. RESULTS: Significant pain relief was observed in 44 and 38% of patients, mild relief in 31 and 34% and no effect in 25 and 28% of patients, 1 and 3 months after administration, respectively. Pain palliation was accompanied by an improvement in mobility and a decrease in necessary dosage of analgesics. Mild and transient bone marrow suppression was observed as a side effect of (153)Sm-EDTMP treatment. None of the patients showed hematological toxicity grade 4, and only 2 showed grade 3 (NCI CTC). The majority of the patients had hematological toxicity grade 1 or 2. CONCLUSION: After (153)Sm-EDTMP administration, bone pain palliation was observed in 72% of patients for 3 months.

We also aimed to correlate IL-6 (as a surrogate marker of NF-kappaB) and docetaxel response in hormone-independent prostate cancer (HIPC) patients. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Hormone-dependent (LNCaP) and hormone-independent (PC-3 and DU-145) prostate cancer cell lines were exposed to docetaxel alone or combined with the NF-kappaB inhibitor PS-1145 (an inhibitor of IkappaB kinase-2). Effects of dose, exposure time, and schedule dependence were assessed. Activation of NF-kappaB was assayed by electrophoresis mobility shift assay and luciferase reporter assay, IL-6 levels by ELISA, and cell viability by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. Cell cycle and apoptosis were assessed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis. Apoptosis was also measured by detection of cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. In patients with metastatic HIPC receiving docetaxel-based chemotherapy, IL-6 serum levels were assayed before chemotherapy and every 3 to 4 weeks thereafter. RESULTS: PC-3 and DU-145 cells had higher NF-kappaB activity, secreted more IL-6, and were more resistant to docetaxel than LNCaP cells. NF-kappaB activity was induced by docetaxel. Cotreatment with docetaxel and PS-1145 prevented docetaxel-induced NF-kappaB activation, reduced IL-6 production, and increased docetaxel effects on cell viability in PC-3 and DU-145 cells but not in LNCaP. Synergism with docetaxel and PS-1145, as assayed by median-effect principle, was observed in DU-145 and PC-3. In HIPC patients, pretreatment IL-6 serum levels correlated to prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response: median IL-6 level was 10.8+/-9.5 pg/mL in PSA responders versus 36.7+/-20.8 pg/mL (P=0.006) in nonresponders. A PSA response was also linked to a decline in IL-6 levels during treatment. Median overall survival was 6.8 months in patients with high IL-6 versus 16.6 months in those with low IL-6 (P=0.0007). On multivariate analysis, pretreatment IL-6 (P=0.05) was an independent prognostic factor for time to disease progression and survival. CONCLUSIONS: Inhibition of NF-kappaB emerges as an attractive strategy to enhance docetaxel response in prostate cancer. The interest of this view is further supported by a significant association between high IL-6 in sera of HIPC patients and decreased response to docetaxel","","","","","","12/18/5578 [pii];10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-05-2767 [doi]","Department of Medical Oncology and Laboratory of Experimental Oncology, Institut Clinic Malalties Hemato-Oncologiques, Hospital Clinic and Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain","PM:17000695","","","",""

However, the response rate to single-agent docetaxel is approximately 40% to 45%, emphasizing a need for alternative approaches. More significantly, with the onset of early, PSA-based detection of prostate cancer and closer follow-up, many men present with metastatic disease that remains asymptomatic. For such patients, the side effects of chemotherapy would compromise their current performance status and, thus, a nontoxic, early treatment option that could improve overall survival would be highly desirable. Immunotherapy represents one such approach; a number of clinical trials have suggested a survival benefit for immunotherapy in metastatic prostate cancer and confirmed that these agents are generally well-tolerated. As is the case for chemotherapy, it is doubtful that maximal survival benefit will be achieved with single-agent immunotherapy; experimental treatments in which mechanistically distinct immunotherapy approaches are combined, as well as approaches in which immunotherapy is combined with chemotherapy or hormonal therapy are currently under investigation. This review will discuss the mechanisms of action of several immunotherapy approaches for metastatic prostate cancer, focusing on active immunotherapy as opposed to administration of anti-tumor antibodies. The relative advantages and disadvantages of current approaches will be noted, and ongoing clinical trials will be highlighted. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Results were compared with the findings of spiral computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and, as regards lymph node metastasis, the ultrasound findings. A total of 116 patients with head and neck tumours (83 males and 33 females aged 27-88 years) were examined using a hybrid PET scanner after injection of 185-350 MBq of [(18)F]FDG (Picker Prism 2000 XP-PCD, Marconi Axis gamma-PET(2) AZ). Hybrid PET examinations were performed in list mode using an axial filter. Reconstruction of data was performed iteratively. Ninety-six patients underwent CT using a multislice technique (Siemens Somatom Plus 4, Marconi MX 8000), 18 patients underwent MRI and 100 patients were examined by ultrasound. All findings were verified by histology, which was considered the gold standard, or, in the event of negative histology, by follow-up. Correct diagnosis of the primary or recurrent lesion was made in 73 of 85 patients using the hybrid PET scanner, in 50 of 76 patients on CT and in 7 of 10 patients on MRI. Hybrid PET successfully visualised metastatic disease in cervical lymph nodes in 28 of 34 patients, while 23 of 31 were correctly diagnosed with CT, 3 of 4 with MRI and 30 of 33 with ultrasound. False positive results regarding lymph node metastasis were seen in three patients with hybrid PET, in 14 patients with CT and in 13 patients with ultrasound. MRI yielded no false positive results concerning lymph node metastasis. In one patient, unrecognised metastatic lesions were seen on hybrid PET elsewhere in the body (lung: n=1; bone: n=1). Additional malignant lesions at sites other than the head and neck tumour were found in three patients (one patient with lung cancer, one patient with pelvic metastasis due to a carcinoma of the prostate and one patient with pulmonary metastasis due to breast cancer). It is concluded that [(18)F]FDG PET with hybrid PET scanners is superior to CT and MRI in the diagnosis of primary or recurrent lesions as well as in the assessment of lymph node involvement, whereas it is inferior to ultrasound in the detection of cervical lymph node metastasis","","","","","","10.1007/s00259-003-1181-6 [doi]","Klinik und Poliklinik fur Nuklearmedizin, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat, Ziemssenstrasse 1, 80336, Munchen, Germany. dresel@nuk.med.uni-muenchen.de","PM:12739070","","","",""

Methods: Men with no priorchemotherapy (group A) and men with docetaxel (Taxotere)-resistant prostate cancer (group B) were treated with sunitinib. The primary end point was confirmed 50% prostate-specific antigen (PSA) decline. Secondary end points included objective respo nse rate and safety. Serum-soluble biomarkers were measured. Results: Seventeen men were enrolled in each group. One confirmed PSA response was observed in each group, and an additional eight men and seven men had stable PSA at week 12 in groups A and B, respectively. Improvements in imaging were observed in the absence of post-treatment PSA declines. Common adverse effects included fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, myelosuppression and transaminase elevation. Significant changes following sunitinib treatment were observed in serum-soluble biomarkers including soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2, platelet-derived growth factor aa, placental growth factor and leptin. Conclusions: Sunitinib monotherapy resulted in few confirmed 50% post-treatment declines in PSA in men with CRPC. Serum markers of angiogenesis confirmed on-target effects of sunitinib. Assessments of radiographic disease status were often discordant with changes in PSA, indicating that alternate end points are important in future trials. (c) The Author 2009.

Adjuvant androgen deprivation combined with external beam radiotherapy has become the gold standard treatment in locally advanced prostate cancer. Combined therapy has been extensively investigated and has shown to improve oncologic outcomes. However, its toxicity is not negligible. Several side effects can be encountered: cardiovascular, bone depletion, metabolic changes and neuropsychologic effects. They may overlap treatment benefits and be responsible of a specific mortality. Nevertheless, randomized studies have demonstrated that there was no increase of specific mortality from combined treatments compared to patients treated by radiotherapy alone. Therefore, these side effects might not be a barrier to adjuvant androgenic deprivation. However, long-term results are still needed and also accurate morbidity studies. In addition, the debate is still ongoing regarding the appropriate duration of hormone therapy","","","","","","S1166-7087(10)70037-3 [pii];10.1016/S1166-7087(10)70037-3 [doi]","Service d'Urologie Hopital Pitie-Salpetriere, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Groupe Hospitalo-Universitaire Est, Faculte de medecine Pierre et Marie Curie, Universite Paris VI, Paris, France","PM:20620963","","","",""

A panel of prostate cancer specialists and geriatric oncologists has developed specific treatment guidelines for this population. These guidelines are valid, internationally accepted and compulsory. However, they must be adapted during the decision-making process as a function of the patients health status. Health status screening is based on dependence, nutrition and evaluation of comorbidities.

Compared to actively treated oncology patients, for whom anemia treatment has demonstrated improved quality of life and symptom alleviation, studies of treatment outcomes in palliative care patients are limited. Knowledge of the extent and causes of anemia in palliative care patients is needed, as correction of anemia in these patients could potentially improve their physical, emotional, and cognitive functioning. In the present study, clinical data and blood test results of 105 patients meeting specific eligibility criteria were examined to estimate the prevalence of anemia and investigate its causes. Ninety-five (90.5%) patients had advanced cancer. Based on World Health Organization criteria, anemia was found in 77% of men (Hb <130 g/l) and 68.2% of women (Hb <120 g/l). The diagnosis was anemia of chronic disease in 76.7% of women and 46.8% of men. Patients with prostate cancer had a significantly lower mean Hb level (P=0.007) and more evidence of bone metastases (P=0.0007) than those with other cancers. Neutrophil hypersegmentation, suggesting occult folate deficiency, was present in 28.6% of patients, being more common in those with major weight loss (58.3%) than those with moderate (37%) or mild/no weight loss (26%) (P=0.019). The findings suggest that anemia is highly prevalent in the palliative care setting. Although anemia of chronic disease is most common, occult folate deficiency may be more prevalent than previously suspected. The findings suggest that a low serum folate level is an insensitive marker of occult folate deficiency. A randomized controlled trial of folic acid treatment is proposed","","","","","","S0885392403004202 [pii]","Mary Potter Hospice, Wellington South, New Zealand","PM:14654265","","","",""

Following a brief period of disease regression that lasts an average of eighteen to twenty-four months, the disease becomes hormone refractory and progresses. Second line hormonal manipulation includes anti-androgen withdrawal, glucocorticoids, estrogens, aminogluthetimide, and ketoconazole. The response from these drugs is usually very short. Once these measures have been exhausted, the clinician is left with limited treatment options that include radionuclides and cytotoxic chemotherapy. It is the objective of this article to review the experience with chemotherapy in prostate cancer and then to discuss the role of radionuclide agents, emerging agents, and herbal therapies.

We explored androgen deprivation therapy related bone loss in prostate cancer, current treatments and emerging therapies. Materials and Methods: Literature published on the pathogenesis and management of androgen deprivation therapy related bone loss was compiled and interpreted. Recent drug therapy findings were reviewed, including treatment guidelines. Results: Men with prostate cancer often present with bone loss and the initiation of androgen deprivation therapy can trigger further rapid decreases. This results in an increased fracture risk, and greater morbidity and mortality. Early detection of osteoporosis through androgen deprivation therapy screening and prompt initiation of therapy are critical to prevent continued decreases. Lifestyle changes such as diet, supplementation and exercise can slow the rate of bone loss. Pharmacological therapy with oral and intravenous bisphosphonates has been demonstrated to prevent or decrease the bone loss associated with androgen deprivation therapy. However, important differences exist among various bisphosphonates with respect to efficacy, compliance and toxicity. Only zoledronic acid has been shown to increase bone mineral density above baseline and provide long-term benefit by decreasing the incidence of fracture and other skeletal related events in men with bone metastases. Conclusions: Androgen deprivation therapy associated bone loss adversely affects bone health, patient quality of life and survival in men with prostate cancer. Increased awareness of this issue, identification of risk factors, lifestyle modification and initiation of bisphosphonate therapy can improve outcomes. Education of patients and physicians regarding the importance of screening, prevention and treatment is essential. (c) 2007 American Urological Association","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As a result, there is a need for more effective therapies that have antitumor and anti-bone metastatic effects. Because Src and Src-family kinases (SFKs) are involved in multiple signaling pathways central to prostate cancer development, progression, and metastasis, in addition to normal and pathologic osteoclast activities, Src inhibition represents a valid therapeutic strategy for investigation. Areas covered in this review: Here, current treatment options for advanced prostate cancer, the preclinical rationale behind using Src inhibitors, emerging data from clinical trials of Src inhibitors in prostate cancer, and future therapeutic directions are described. Data published in peer-reviewed journals within the last 20 years or presented at recent European or American Society of Clinical Oncology conferences have been reviewed. What the reader will gain: Readers will gain an insight into the development of therapeutic Src inhibitors, including dasatinib and saracatinib; an understanding of their effects on prostate cancer cells and the bone microenvironment; and emerging clinical data. Take home message: Src is implicated in prostate cancer progression and metastasis, therefore treatment with Src inhibitors warrants further investigation.

However, in contrast to other cancers, the expected increase in efficacy with the use of chemotherapy in earlier disease states has not been reported to date in prostate cancer. On the basis of these observations, we speculated that the therapy development paradigm used successfully in other cancers may not apply to the majority of prostate cancers. Several lines of supporting clinical and experimen tal observations implicate the tumor microenvironment in prostate carcinogenesis and resistance to therapy. We conclude that a foundation to guide the development of therapy for prostate cancer is required. The therapy paradigm we propose accounts for the central role of the tumor microenvironment in bone and, if correct, will lead to microenvironmenttargeted therapy.

However, the favorable outcome seen in recent pilot studies of intermittent androgen ablation raises the possibility of overtreatment. METHODS: This study included 35 Japanese men with advanced prostate cancer. Initial androgen ablation continued for 2 months after PSA levels decreased to <4.0 ng/ml, then was withdrawn. Androgen ablation was reinstituted 2 months after PSA reached levels >10 ng/ml, when indicated clinically or on patient request. Cycling continued until androgen independence was reached. RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 21.0 months, representing an average of 2.5 cycles. Nine patients developed androgen independence at an average of 16.0 months following androgen ablation; three of these have died. Six of the nine patients with early biochemical progression had elevated alkaline phosphatase levels at entry; five of these exhibited a flare in alkaline phosphatase activity after initiation of androgen ablation. Mean bone mineral density (BMD) in the lumbar spines of 17 patients was 81.5 mg/cm3 at 23 months following therapy. The BMD of 10 of these patients was normal for their age. Four patients suffered bone fractures, none pathological. CONCLUSIONS: Intermittent androgen ablation may be an option for patients with advanced prostate cancer and may be especially beneficial for those with initially low BMD levels. Patients with elevated alkaline phosphatase levels at entry or a flare in its activity may not be ideal candidates. Whether prolonging time to androgen independence will provide benefit remains to be investigated in a randomized, prospective study","","","","","","","Department of Urology, Kitasato University School of Medicine, Sagamihara, Kanagawa, Japan. s-egpro@sa2.so-net.ne.jp","PM:10770564","","","",""

In a multicenter retrospective study we evaluated the actuarial rates and predictors of remaining on active surveillance, the incidence of cancer progression and the pathological findings of delayed radical prostatectomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cohort of 262 men from 4 institutions met the inclusion criteria of age 75 years or younger, prostate specific antigen 10 ng/ml or less, clinical stage T1-T2a, biopsy Gleason sum 6 or less, 3 or less positive cores at diagnostic biopsy, repeat biopsy before active surveillance and no treatment for 6 months following the repeat biopsy. Active surveillance started on the date of the second biopsy. Actuarial rates of remaining on active surveillance were calculated and univariate Cox regression was used to assess predictors of discontinuing active surveillance. RESULTS: With a median followup of 29 months 43 patients ultimately received active treatment. The 2 and 5-year probabilities of remaining on active surveillance were 91% and 75%, respectively. Patients with cancer on the second biopsy (HR 2.23, 95% CI 1.23-4.06, p = 0.007) and a higher number of cancerous cores from the 2 biopsies combined (p = 0.002) were more likely to undergo treatment. Age, prostate specific antigen, clinical stage, prostate volume and number of total biopsy cores sampled were not predictive of outcome. Skeletal metastases developed in 1 patient 38 months after starting active surveillance. Of the 43 patients undergoing delayed treatment 41 (95%) are without disease progression at a median of 23 months following treatment. CONCLUSIONS: With a median followup of 29 months active surveillance for select patients appears to be safe and associated with a low risk of systemic progression. Cancer at restaging biopsy and a higher total number of cancerous cores are associated with a lower likelihood of remaining on active surveillance. A restaging biopsy should be strongly considered to finalize eligibility for active surveillance","","","","","","S0022-5347(08)03272-2 [pii];10.1016/j.juro.2008.11.109 [doi]","University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA","PM:19233410","","","",""

However, in recent years, not only have novel chemotherapy regimens shown promise in men with prostate cancer, but new therapeutic targets have also been identified as our understanding of disease progression has deepened. The gold standard treatment for patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer is now docetaxel every 3 wk plus low-dose prednisone. In addition, ongoing clinical investigations are evaluating docetaxel-based chemotherapy in combination with newer agents, such as bevacizumab, oblimersen, calcitriol, and thalidomide. A large number of agents are also being investigated in clinical trials that employ novel mechanisms of action, such as targeting bone metastases, the androgen receptor, or components of the tumor intracellular-signalling pathways. Furthermore, the encouraging results in the metastatic disease settings, have prompted the exploration of these treatment strategies in the adjuvant and neoadjuvant settings, where currently available treatment options fail to offer a cure to high-risk patients with locally advanced prostate cancer. The traditional treatment paradigm for prostate cancer, therefore, is being replaced by a multidisciplinary approach. To provide patients with prostate cancer with the best chance of survival and quality of life, urologists and oncologists must maintain close working relationships to determine the most appropriate treatment strategy for an individual patient.

A promising and relatively novel drug platform is virotherapy, which has demonstrated potent and selective antitumor efficacy in cancer cell lines and in preclinical in vivo tumor models, accompanied by minimal toxicity to normal cells. Safety and limited toxicity has also been demonstrated in many clinical trials targeting various solid cancers. Results from early-stage trials in patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancers have revealed potential efficacy following intraprostatic or intravenous delivery of replication-selective oncolytic viruses in combination with chemotherapeutics or radiation therapy. This review describes the most promising developments in virotherapy for prostate cancer, focusing on replication-selective adenoviral mutants as multimodal therapeutic agents.

However, overall and cardiac-specific toxicity was reported to be high. Mitoxantrone has activity similar to that of doxorubicin, is less cardiotoxic, and is widely used to treat prostate cancer. The current study sought to evaluate the toxicity and activity of mitoxantrone plus ketoconazole in a cohort of patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer. METHODS: Progression after medical or surgical castration and, for those patients receiving antiandrogens, progression after withdrawal was required, as was objective evidence of metastasis, castrate levels of testosterone, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 2, and intact cardiac function. After enrollment onto a multicenter local consortium study, subjects were treated with mitoxantrone at a dose of 12 mg/m2 intravenously every 3 weeks plus continuous oral ketoconazole at a dose of 400 mg 3 times daily and ascorbic acid at a dose of 250 mg. Replacement doses of hydrocortisone were given. RESULTS: For 40 enrolled subjects, the median prostate-specific antigen and ECOG performance status were 68 and 1, respectively, 53% had Gleason scores of 8 to 10, and all had metastasis. Predominant Grade 3/4 toxicities were: neutropenia in 13%, neutropenic fever in 10%, and anemia in 13%. Of 37 evaluable patients, 8% achieved a complete remission (CR) and 62% achieved a partial remission (PR), for a CR plus PR rate of 70%. For soft tissue and bone disease, overall response rates were 13% and 8%, respectively. The median progression-free survival and overall survival were 10 months and 18 months, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Mitoxantrone plus ketoconazole is well tolerated, is active in hormone-refractory prostate cancer, and should be studied further","","","","","","10.1002/cncr.21880 [doi]","Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Northwestern University Medical School, Chicago 60611-3008, and Ingalls Hospital, Harvey, Illinois, USA","PM:16615097","","","",""

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Men with HRPC, bone metastases, and bone pain were randomly assigned to receive clodronate 1,500 mg administered intravenously (IV) or placebo every 3 weeks, in combination with mitoxantrone 12 mg/m2 IV every 3 weeks and prednisone 5 mg orally bid. Patients completed the present pain intensity (PPI) index and Prostate Cancer-Specific Quality-of-Life Instrument at each treatment visit and used a diary to record analgesic use on a daily basis. The primary end point was a reduction to zero or of two points in the PPI or a decrease of 50% in analgesic intake, without increase in either. RESULTS: The study accrued 209 eligible patients over 44 months. One hundred sixty patients (77%) had mild PPI scores (1 or 2), and 49 (24%) had moderate PPI scores (3 or 4). The primary end point of palliative response was achieved in 46 (46%) of 104 patients on the clodronate arm and in 41 (39%) of 105 patients on the placebo arm (P =.54). The median duration of response, symptomatic disease progression-free survival, overall survival, and overall quality of life were similar between the arms. Subgroup analysis suggested possible benefit in patients with more severe pain. CONCLUSION: MP provides useful palliation in symptomatic men with HRPC. Clodronate does not increase the rate of palliative response or overall quality of life. Clodronate may be beneficial to patients who have moderate pain, but this requires further confirmation","","","","","","10.1200/JCO.2003.03.042 [doi];JCO.2003.03.042 [pii]","Tom Baker Cancer Center, Calgary, Canada. scott.ernst@lrcc.on.ca","PM:12947070","","","",""

Patients, methods: We evaluated retrospectively 42 patients with untreated prostate cancer (n = 17), or increasing levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) after curative therapy (n = 25) who had been investigated by both Cho-PET/CT and WB-MRI. MRI, CT, and PET images were separately analyzed by experienced radiologists or nuclear medicine experts, followed by consensus reading. Validation was established by histology, follow-up, or consensus reading. Results: 88/103 detected lesions were considered as malignant: 44 bone metastases, 22 local tumor, 15 lymph node metastases, 3 lung, and 3 brain metastases. One further lesion was located in the adrenal gland, which was a second tumor. Overall sensitivity, specificity and accuracy for Cho-PET/CT were 96.6%, 76.5%, and 93.3%, resp., and for WB-MRI 78.4%, 94.1%, and 81.0%, resp. 3 vertebral metastases had initially been missed by Cho-PET/CT and were found retrospectively. MRI identified 2 bone metastases and 1 lymph node metastasis after being informed about the results of Cho-PET/CT. Conclusions: Cho-PET/CT and WB-MRI both presented high accuracy in the detection of bone and lymph node metastases.

IRSAC produces images that are more pleasing to the eye, but qualitative and quantitative comparisons between IRSAC and filtered back projection (FBP) have not been reported for metastatic cancer. Since quantitative data has been widely used as an adjunct to interpretation of PET scans, comparison between IRSAC and FBP is needed. The purpose of this study was to compare image quality and the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) obtained with FBP and with IRSAC in metastatic lesions from prostate cancer. METHODS: Twenty (18)F-FDG PET scans (10 baseline and 10 follow-up) were performed in 10 patients with prostate cancer (ages 66-85 yrs, mean 73.6 yrs). Acquisition began 45 min after injection of 370 MBq of (18)F-FDG. Images were reconstructed using FBP and IRSAC, and submitted to visual and quantitative analysis. SUVmax was obtained for all metastases, on FBP and IRSAC. A Jaszczak phantom study was also performed. RESULTS: IRSAC images showed better image quality than FBP especially in regions of high activity concentrations. IRSAC detected 106 lesions on both baseline and follow-up scans, while FBP detected 100 and 95 lesions on baseline and follow-up scans, respectively. Therefore, 17 more lesions were seen on IRSAC. The mean SUVmax values on baseline scans for FBP and IRSAC were systematically different, at 4.46+/-1.99 and 5.13+/-2.67, respectively. On follow-up scans values were 3.89+/-1.72 for FBP and 4.29+/-1.93 for IRSAC. Comparison of FBP with IRSAC on baseline and follow-up scans were statistically significant (baseline: paired 't'-test p=0.0017; follow-up: paired 't'-test p=0.0008). Phantom studies reveal that these differences can be explained by the type of reconstruction filters used, and IRSAC was more accurate than FBP. CONCLUSIONS: IRSAC detects smaller volumes in phantoms, patient images are easier to interpret and more metastatic lesions were detected. In addition, IRSAC provides reproducible quantitative data, comparable to data provided by FBP. IRSAC SUV and FBP SUV are in close agreement but there was a statistically significant difference between the two, and therefore threshold values of SUV will probably need to be re-determined with IRSAC, and are likely to be 10 to 19% higher than currently reported","","","","","","","Nuclear Medicine Service, Department of Radiology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, USA","PM:12114875","","","",""

Methods: In a prospective study, BS and SUP 18F-Fluoride PET/CT were performed on the same day in 44 patients with high-risk prostate cancer. In 20 of the latter patients planar BS was followed by single field-of-view (FOV) SPECT and in 24 patients by multi-FOV SPECT of the axial skeleton. Lesions were interpreted separately on each of the 4 modalities as normal, benign, equivocal, or malignant. Results: In patient-based analysis, 23 patients had skeletal metastatic spread (52%) and 21 did not. Categorizing equivocal and malignant interpretation as suggestive for malignancy, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of planar BS were 70%, 57%, 64%, and 55%, respectively, of multi-FOV SPECT were 92%, 82%, 86%, and 90%, of SUP 18F-Fluoride PET were 100%, 62%, 74%, and 100%, and of SUP 18F-Fluoride PET/CT were 100% for all parameters. Using the McNemar test, SUP 18F-Fluoride PET/CT was st atistically more sensitive and more specific than planar or SPECT BS (P < 0.05) and more specific than SUP 18F-Fluoride PET (P < 0.001). SPECT was statistically more sensitive and more specific than planar BS (P < 0.05) but was less sensitive than SUP 18F-Fluoride PET (P < 0.05). In lesion-based analysis, 156 lesions with increased uptake of SUP 18F-Fluoride were assessed. Based on the corresponding appearance on CT, lesions were categorized by PET/CT as benign (n = 99), osteoblastic metastasis (n = 46), or equivocal when CT was normal (n = 11). Of the 156 SUP 18F-Fluoride lesions, 81 lesions (52%), including 34 metastases, were overlooked with normal appearance on planar BS. SPECT identified 62% of the lesions overlooked by planar BS. SUP 18F-Fluoride PET/CT was more sensitive and more specific than BS (P < 0.001) and more specific than PET alone (P < 0.001). Conclusion: SUP 18F-Fluoride PET/CT is a highly sensitive and specific modality for detection of bone metastases in patients with high-risk prostate cancer. It is more specific than SUP 18F-Fluoride PET alone and more sensitive and specific than planar and SPECT BS. Detection of bone metastases is improved by SPECT compared with planar BS and by SUP 18F-Fluoride PET compared with SPECT. This added value of SUP 18F-Fluoride PET/CT may beneficially impact the clinical management of patients with high-risk prostate cancer","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, according to previous surveys, SF schedules remain underused. The objectives of this study were to determine the current patterns of practice internationally and to investigate the factors influencing this practice. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The members of three global radiation oncology professional organizations (American Society for Radiology Oncology [ASTRO], Canadian Association of Radiation Oncology [CARO], Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists) completed an Internet-based survey. The respondents described what radiotherapy dose fractionation they would recommend for 5 hypothetical cases describing patients with single or multiple painful BMs from breast, lung, or prostate cancer. Radiation oncologists rated the importance of patient, tumor, institution, and treatment factors, and descriptive statistics were compiled. The chi-square test was used for categorical variables and the Student t test for continuous variables. Logistic regression analysis identified predictors of the use of SF radiotherapy. RESULTS: A total of 962 respondents, three-quarters ASTRO members, described 101 different dose schedules in common use (range, 3 Gy/1 fraction to 60 Gy/20 fractions). The median dose overall was 30 Gy/10 fractions. SF schedules were used the least often by ASTRO members practicing in the United States and most often by CARO members. Case, membership affiliation, country of training, location of practice, and practice type were independently predictive of the use of SF. The principal factors considered when prescribing were prognosis, risk of spinal cord compression, and performance status. CONCLUSION: Despite abundant evidence, most radiation oncologists continue to prescribe multifraction schedules for patients who fit the eligibility criteria of previous randomized controlled trials. Our results have confirmed a delay in the incorporation of evidence into practice for palliative radiotherapy for painful bone metastases","","","","","","S0360-3016(09)00199-0 [pii];10.1016/j.ijrobp.2008.12.084 [doi]","Department of Radiation Oncology, Cross Cancer Institute, Edmonton, AB, Canada. alysafai@cancerboard.ab.ca","PM:19464820","","","",""

In the metastatic setting, a number of treatment options are available, with androgen-deprivation therapy being the first-choice, but few studies have examined the feasibility and efficacy of endocrine therapy and chemotherapy in men aged 70 years or older. Since the preservation of quality of life is the main objective of treatment in metastatic prostate cancer, every therapeutic decision should be conditioned by results of a geriatric comprehensive assessment.

The procedures for evaluation of the scientific literature are described separately (Acta Oncol 2003; 42: 357-365). This synthesis of the literature on radiation therapy for skeletal metastases is based on data from 16 randomized trials. Moreover, data from 20 prospective studies, 5 retrospective studies and 22 other articles were used. A total of 63 scientific articles are included, involving 8051 patients. The results were compared with those of a similar overview from 1996 including 13,054 patients. The conclusions reached can be summarized as follows: Irradiation of skeletal metastases is, with few exceptions, a palliative treatment. There is strong evidence that radiotherapy of skeletal metastases gives an overall (complete and partial pain relief) in more than 80% of patients. There is strong evidence that the duration of pain relief in at least 50% of patients lasts for > or = 6 months. There is convincing evidence that pain relief, in terms of degree and duration, does not depend on the fractionation schedules applied. Irrespective of the fractionation schedule used at irradiation, the number of later complications, such as spinal cord compression or pathological fractures, at the index fields are low. There are some data showing that the difference in cost between single and multifraction treatment is small. However, these data do not permit any firm conclusions to be drawn. Several reports indicate that early diagnosis and early therapy of spinal cord compression are the two most important predictors of a favourable clinical outcome after radiotherapy. However, no controlled studies have been undertaken. When the diagnosis of spinal cord compression is late, a favourable outcome might depend on the radio-responsiveness of the tumour. The documentation is weak and no conclusions can be drawn. There is some evidence that a small proportion of totally paralytic patients can regain walking function after radiotherapy. There is strong evidence that the radionuclides 89Sr and 153Sm are efficient when they are used as a systemic treatment of generalized bone pain due to metastasis from carcinomas of the prostate and breast. Overall bone pain relief occurs in about 60-80% of patients with a median response duration of 2-4 months. There is strong evidence that intravenous treatment with bisphosphonates in patients with myeloma and osteolytic bone metastasis due to carcinoma of the breast significantly decreases the number of skeleton-related events and bone pain","","","","","","","Department of Oncology, University Hospital, Trondheim, Norway. ursula.falkmer@medisin.ntnu.no","PM:14596519","","","",""

These hormonal treatments may cause a myriad of side effects, such as osteoporosis with increased risk of fractures, anemia, behavioral changes and lack of sexual interest. We evaluated the feasibility of intermittent androgen replacement in surgically castrated patients with significant side effects. METHODS: Five patients with advanced prostate cancer, ranging from 71 to 77 years of age (mean age = 74 years), surgically castrated for at least 3 years, with important symptoms of hypoandrogenism received testosterone replacement. They were followed with PSA and testosterone measurement every other month and bone scans every 6 months. RESULTS: For the first year all patients improved significantly, none of them showed PSA increase over 10 ng/ml. There was no evidence of local recurrence or distant disease. After 18 months, only one patient (20%) had a significant PSA increase, controlled by androgen withdrawal. No side effects or metastasis were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Hormonal replacement in patients that underwent castration seems to be feasible in improving intense symptoms associated to androgen deprivation. After 18 months, no evidence of recurrence was noted. It is an experimental alternative for highly symptomatic patients, but the short follow-up and the small number of patients cannot allow for definitive conclusions and should be studied further","","","","","","4500833 [pii];10.1038/sj.pcan.4500833 [doi]","Department of Urology, Universidade Estadual de Campinas--UNICAMP, Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil. ubirafer@uol.com.br","PM:16276352","","","",""

Ketoconazole (KT) has demonstrated activity in androgen independent prostate cancer (AIPC). In this study we determined whether KT plus AL produced acceptable disease responses compared with KT alone. As the experimental design, 72 patients with progressive AIPC metastatic to bone were randomized to receive KT (1,200 mg daily) plus hydrocortisone (H) (30 mg daily) with or without AL (40 mg daily). Prostate specific antigen (PSA) consensus criteria and radiographic scans were used to determine the proportion of patients with a PSA decrease, time to progression and response duration. The pharmacokinetics of KT and AL were characterized and changes in circulating angiogenic factors were assessed. RESULTS: At a median potential followup of 23.9 months the proportion of patients with a greater than 50% decrease in PSA was similar in the KT/H/AL and KT/H, groups (50% and 47%, respectively). The median duration of response was 8.9 and 6.3 months in the KT/H/AL and KT/H groups, respectively (p = 0.125). Median progression-free survival was not significantly prolonged in the KT/H/AL group (4.6 vs 3.8 months, p = 0.27). There was no significant difference in overall survival between the 2 treatment arms but there was a trend toward improved survival in the KT/H arm (p = 0.074). Toxicity in the 2 groups was mild and there were no clear associations between changes in circulating angiogenic factor levels and clinical outcomes in either treatment arm. CONCLUSIONS: There were no statistically significant differences in response rate, progression-free survival or overall survival between KT/H alone and KT/H plus AL treatment in patients with AIPC.

PATIENTS, MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the pre-clinical evaluation we injected PC3 cells subcutaneously into severely combined immunodeficient mice and started treatment after the tumour volume reached 50 mm SUP 3. We also evaluated the combination using luciferase-labelled PC3M-luc-C6 cells in nude mice. We enrolled 20 patients with metastatic progressive AIPC into a phase II clinical trial to evaluate this combination. Docetaxel (30 mg/m SUP 2) was administered every week, for 3 of 4 weeks. The dose of thalidomide was 200 mg/day and estramustine was given three times a day at 1, 2, 3, 8, 9, 10, 15, 16 and 17 days. RESULTS: In the mice, thalidomide with docetaxel plus estramustine reduced tumour volume by 88% at 17 days vs the control treatment (p = 0.001). The combination of docetaxel, estramustine and thalidomide nearly eradicated the signal from the luciferase-expressing PC3M cells in the metastasis model. Clinically, the progression-free time was 7.2 months with this combination; 18 of 20 patients had a decline of half or more in prostate-specific antigen level and two of 10 patients with soft-tissue lesions had a partial response on computed tomog raphy. There were 24 grade 3 and two grade 4 complications associated with this combination. There was a statistically significant association between overall survival and the CYP1B1*3 genotype (P = 0.013). CONCLUSION: Docetaxel-based chemotherapy is now regarded as a standard regimen for metastatic AIPC. The combination of estramustine, docetaxel and thalidomide is an advantageous treatment in pre-clinical models of prostate cancer and is a safe, tolerable and active regimen in patients with AIPC","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Pain occurs as a result of bone destruction and, as more destruction ensues, more pain can be experienced. Radiculopathies, plexopathies and shrinkage of spinal nerves due to tumour growth and fractures are very frequent in these patients. Relief of pain from bone metastasis can be achieved by treating the cancer itself; radiotherapy; conventional analgesics; and specific drugs that work on the bone tumour-induced alteration: biphosphonates, calcitonin or radioactive agents. OBJECTIVES: To determine the efficacy of radioisotopes to control metastatic pain in patients with bone metastases and complications due to bone metastases (hypercalcaemia, bone fracture and spinal cord compression) as well as its efficacy in terms of patient survival and adverse effects. SEARCH STRATEGY: Randomised and controlled clinical trials related to this review were retrieved electronically using MEDLINE (1966-2003), EMBASE (1974-2003) and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 1 2003). general strategies to identify RCTs were combined with specific commands to identify trials of radioisotopes and metastatic bone pain. SELECTION CRITERIA: The inclusion criteria were: randomised trials of patients with metastatic bone pain that compared treatment with radioisotopes and placebo, and where the major outcome was either pain or complications of bone metastases (eg, hypercalcaemia, bone fracture, spinal cord compression) assessed at least four weeks after treatment. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The quality of included studies was assessed using the Jadad scale and the Oxford Pain Validity Score. Two independent review authors extracted the data and completed a standard form designed for that purpose. An intention-to-treat analysis was performed, and global estimates of effect were calculated using a random effects model. MAIN RESULTS: Four trials (325 patients) provided data that suggest a small effect of radioisotopes on pain control both at short and medium term (one to six months). No evidence was available to assess long-term effects (12 months). Only one study provided data on analgesia use and concluded that patients given either radioisotopes or placebo showed similar levels of analgesic use when compared to baseline use. Leukocytopenia and thrombocytopenia are secondary effects associated with the administration of radioisotopes. The incidence of leukocytopenia is significantly greater in patients treated with radioisotopes (RR=4.56, 95% CI (1.22,17.08)). There were also a greater number of thrombocytopenia events in the treatment group, without reaching statistical significance. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of radioisotopes has been assessed in clinical trials with small sample sizes and short-term evaluations of the outcomes. There is some evidence indicating that radioisotopes may give complete reduction in pain over one to six months with no increase in analgesic use, but adverse effects, specifically leukocytopenia and thrombocytopenia, have also been experienced. RADIOISOTOPES FOR METASTATIC BONE PAIN: There is insufficient evidence to show whether or not radioisotopes are effective for the relief of pain from bone metastasesPain is commonly experienced by people whose cancer has spread to their bones. There are several ways to treat this pain, including the administration of radioactive drugs that act on the bone to reduce the effects of the cancer. This review looked at the effectiveness of radioisotopes for relieving pain, reducing patients' needs for conventional pain-killers, improvements in quality of life, and increased survival. However, the clinical trials available for assessment were too small and too short-term to enable meaningful results to be obtained. There is some evidence that radioisotopes may give pain relief over one to six months but the treatment also seemed to be associated with adverse effects, notably reducing the numbers of some important blood cells","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For example, bone metastases occur in approximately 80% of patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer and in approximately 25% of patients with renal cell carcinoma. A sufficient and early therapy is crucial since adequate therapy can lead to significant improvements in pain control and function and maintain skeletal integrity. The effective treatment of bone metastases requires multidisciplinary cooperation between urologists, oncologists, surgeons, nuclear medicine physicians and radiation oncologists. Analgesic measures, bisphosphonates, radionuclides, radiation therapy as well as surgical procedures are available. This review will focus mainly on the role of analgetics, bisphosphonates, radionuclides and radiolabelled bisphosphonates in the treatment of bone metastases","","","","","","10.1007/s00120-007-1521-4 [doi]","Klinik fur Urologie und Kinderurologie, Universitatsklinikum Ulm, 89075, Ulm. florian.finter@uniklinik-ulm.de","PM:17639296","","","",""

Bisphosphonates, including zoledronic acid, are widely used in the management of metastatic bone disease. Objective: To summarise current insights into the use of zoledronic acid in patients with bone metastases secondary to genitourinary malignancies, including prostate cancer (PCa), renal cell carcinoma (RCC), and bladder cancer (BCa). In addition, the potential of bone marker measurements to guide treatment decisions in PCa will be discussed. Evidence acquisition: This manuscript is based on presentations given at an educational session held during the 2nd World Congress on Controversies in Urology (CURy) in Lisbon, Portugal. Data were retrieved from original manuscripts, recent review papers, and abstracts on the use of zoledronic acid for treatment of bone metastases from PCa, RCC, or BCa and the potential of bone markers to facilitate treatment decisions in PCa. Evidence synthesis: In patients with bone metastases secondary to PCa, RCC, and BCa enrolled in randomised, placebo-controlled trials, monthly zoledronic acid at 4 mg significantly reduced the proportion of patients with at least one skeletal-related event (SRE) and delayed the onset of SREs compared with placebo. Although more research is warranted, zoledronic acid seems to improve overall survival in these patients. In addition, ongoing trials are evaluating the antitumour effect of zoledronic ac id. Based on retrospective trials, biochemical markers of bone remodelling, including N-telopeptide of type I collagen, seem to identify metastatic PCa patients at high risk for SREs or death. Conclusions: The use of zoledronic acid has been shown to be effective in reducing SREs in patients with bone metastases from genitourinary malignancies. Clinical trials are currently ongoing to evaluate whether zoledronic acid also has a direct antitumour activity in addition to its bone-preserving activity. Although well-designed, prospective, randomised trials are needed, bone marker measurements may be used as a tool to guide treatment decisions.

Objective: To provide practical clinical guidance for physicians and to promote the implementation of recent advances in the management of genitourinary cancers through closer collaboration among urologists, medical oncologists, and radiation oncologists. Evidence acquisition: This article was developed from presentations given at IGUCC 2009. Evidence synthesis: Docetaxel treatment is established as the standard first-line treatment for patients with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), based on improvements in overall survival regardless of age, performance status, and pain. Treatment should be introduced according to risk-factor assessment, clinical status, and patient values and preferences. Similarly, management of senior adults with mCRPC should be individually adapted to the patient's health status rather than c hronologic age, especially since the benefits and toxicity associated with docetaxel treatment are similar in senior adults and younger patients. Asymptomatic patients with adverse prognostic factors for survival such as visceral metastases, anaemia, and new bone lesions may be candidates for chemotherapy. Prognostic nomograms based on pretreatment parameters aid in identifying patients for earlier chemotherapy. Second-line treatments for CRPC patients are needed, but currently no agent has demonstrated efficacy in phase 3 clinical trials. For patients with a prior response to docetaxel, retreatment at relapse can be effective and well tolerated. There is a strong ra tionale for targeting angiogenesis in renal cell carcinoma (RCC), and new targeted therapies have changed treatment paradigms for RCC. In contrast, little progress has been made in the treatment of advanced bladder cancer since the introduction of cisplatin-based chemotherapy; new strategies are needed. Conclusions: Docetaxel (every 3 wk) treatment is a therapeutic option in elderly and asymptomatic mCRPC patients. Docetaxel retreatment is effective in initial responders.

Aberrant Src/SFK activity has been widely implicated in cancer development. Several lines of evidence indicate a role for SFKs in the development of prostate cancer, e.g. SFK overexpression in prostate cancer cell lines and tissues and reduced cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and migration following Src inhibition. In particular, Src may be involved in androgen-independent growth during advanced stages of disease. Src signaling is also a key pathway during normal and dysregulated bone functioning, and bone metastases are responsible for substantial morbidity in advanced prostate cancer. Src/SFK inhibition therefore represents a potentially useful therapeutic strategy for patients with various stages of prostate cancer. To date, four Src inhibitors have reached clinical trials. Of these, the broadest range of in vitro prostate cancer data are available for dasatinib, which inhibits several SFKs as well as other tyrosine kinases.

Osteoclast mediated bone resorption can be assessed by measuring urine N-telopeptide and can be inhibited by denosumab, a fully human antibody against RANKL. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eligible patients (111) had bone metastases from prostate cancer, other solid tumors or multiple myeloma, 1 or more bone lesions and urine N-telopeptide greater than 50 nM bone collagen equivalents per mM creatinine (urine N-telopeptide greater than 50) despite the use of intravenous bisphosphonates. Patients were stratified by cancer type and screening urine N-telopeptide, and randomized to continue intravenous bisphosphonates every 4 weeks or receive 180 mg subcutaneous denosumab every 4 weeks or 180 mg every 12 weeks. The primary end point was the proportion of patients with urine N-telopeptide less than 50 at week 13. We report the efficacy results for the subset of patients with prostate cancer. RESULTS: Patients with prostate cancer represented 45% (50 of 111) of the study population. At week 13, 22 of 32 (69%) patients in the denosumab arms had urine N-telopeptide less than 50 vs 3 of 16 (19%) in the intravenous bisphosphonates cohort. At week 25, 22 of 32 (69%) denosumab treated patients continued to have urine N-telopeptide less than 50 vs 5 of 16 (31%) treated with intravenous bisphosphonates. Grade 4, asymptomatic, reversible hypophosphatemia, possibly related to denosumab, was reported in 1 patient. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with prostate cancer related bone metastases and increased urine N-telopeptide despite intravenous bisphosphonate treatment, denosumab normalized urine N-telopeptide levels more frequently than ongoing intravenous bisphosphonates","","","","","","S0022-5347(09)00932-X [pii];10.1016/j.juro.2009.04.023 [doi]","Institut Gustave Roussy and University of Paris XI, Villejuif, France. fizazi@igr.fr","PM:19524963","","","",""

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with bone metastases from CRPC who achieved a response or stabilization after four cycles of docetaxel and estramustine were given consolidation docetaxel 20 mg/m(2)/wk for 6 weeks and samarium-153-EDTMP (37 MBq/kg) during week 1. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response was assessed by using consensus criteria, and pain was assessed by using a visual analog scale (VAS). This study used a Simon two-step design with PSA-progression-free survival (PFS) as the primary end point. RESULTS: Forty-three patients were included in the trial. A PSA response was obtained in 77% (95% CI, 61% to 82%). The pain response rate was 69% (95% CI, 49% to 85%). At least five of the six planned weekly injections of docetaxel were administered to 34 patients (81%). The consolidation docetaxel-samarium-153-EDTMP regimen was well tolerated; there was no febrile neutropenia, and only two episodes (5%) of rapidly reversible grade 3 thrombocytopenia occurred. Although a serum PSA relapse eventually occurred in all patient cases, this regimen resulted in pain control in the long-term. The median PSA-PFS was 6.4 months (95% CI, 6 to 7 months). The median survival was 29 months (95% CI, 22 to 31); the 1-year survival rate was 77% (62% to 87%); and the 2-year survival rate was 56% (41% to 70%). CONCLUSION: Combining docetaxel and samarium-153-EDTMP in patients with bone metastases from CRPC is well tolerated, and it yields major pain relief that persists long after treatment. Overall survival compares favorably with that expected in this population of patients, most of whom exhibit symptoms","","","","","","JCO.2008.18.9811 [pii];10.1200/JCO.2008.18.9811 [doi]","Department of Medicine, Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France. fizazi@igr.fr","PM:19364971","","","",""

We evaluated the effect of denosumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody against RANKL, in patients with bone metastases and elevated uNTx levels despite ongoing intravenous (IV) bisphosphonate (BP) therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible patients had histologically confirmed malignancy, > or = 1 bone metastases, and uNTx levels higher than 50 nmol/L bone collagen equivalents (BCE)/mM creatinine despite IV BPs. They were stratified by tumor type and screening uNTx levels (50 to 100 or > 100 nmol/L BCE/mM creatinine), and randomly assigned to continue IV BPs every 4 weeks or receive subcutaneous denosumab 180 mg every 4 weeks or every 12 weeks. RESULTS: Among 111 patients accrued, the primary end point of uNTx levels lower than 50 nmol/L BCE/mM creatinine (uNTx < 50) at week 13 was achieved by 49 (71%) of 69 patients in the denosumab arms, compared with 10 (29%) of 35 patients in the IV BP arm (P < .001). The proportion of patients with uNTx lower than 50 was maintained at week 25 (64% denosumab arms; 37% IV BP arm; P = .01). The incidence of SREs was six (8%) of 73 and six (17%) of 35 in the denosumab group and IV BP group, respectively. Rates of adverse events were similar between treatment groups.

We compared denosumab, a human monoclonal antibody against RANKL, with zoledronic acid for prevention of skeletal-related events in men with bone metastases from castration-resistant prostate cancer. METHODS: In this phase 3 study, men with castration-resistant prostate cancer and no previous exposure to intravenous bisphosphonate were enrolled from 342 centres in 39 countries. An interactive voice response system was used to assign patients (1:1 ratio), according to a computer-generated randomisation sequence, to receive 120 mg subcutaneous denosumab plus intravenous placebo, or 4 mg intravenous zoledronic acid plus subcutaneous placebo, every 4 weeks until the primary analysis cutoff date. Randomisation was stratified by previous skeletal-related event, prostate-specific antigen concentration, and chemotherapy for prostate cancer within 6 weeks before randomisation. Supplemental calcium and vitamin D were strongly recommended. Patients, study staff, and investigators were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was time to first on-study skeletal-related event (pathological fracture, radiation therapy, surgery to bone, or spinal cord compression), and was assessed for non-inferiority. The same outcome was further assessed for superiority as a secondary endpoint. Efficacy analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00321620, and has been completed. FINDINGS: 1904 patients were randomised, of whom 950 assigned to denosumab and 951 assigned to receive zoledronic acid were eligible for the efficacy analysis. Median duration on study at primary analysis cutoff date was 12.2 months (IQR 5.9-18.5) for patients on denosumab and 11.2 months (IQR 5.6-17.4) for those on zoledronic acid. Median time to first on-study skeletal-related event was 20.7 months (95% CI 18.8-24.9) with denosumab compared with 17.1 months (15.0-19.4) with zoledronic acid (hazard ratio 0.82, 95% CI 0.71-0.95; p = 0.0002 for non-inferiority; p = 0.008 for superiority). Adverse events were recorded in 916 patients (97%) on denosumab and 918 patients (97%) on zoledronic acid, and serious adverse events were recorded in 594 patients (63%) on denosumab and 568 patients (60%) on zoledronic acid. More events of hypocalcaemia occurred in the denosumab group (121 [13%]) than in the zoledronic acid group (55 [6%]; p<0.0001). Osteonecrosis of the jaw occurred infrequently (22 [2%] vs 12 [1%]; p = 0.09). INTERPRETATION: Denosumab was better than zoledronic acid for prevention of skeletal-related events, and potentially represents a novel treatment option in men with bone metastases from castration-resistant prostate cancer.

Patients received the combination of carboplatin and etoposide every 3 weeks. Efficacy end points included prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and neuroendocrine marker response, objective response and toxicity. RESULTS: Of the 60 patients included from April 2005 to January 2008, 78.6% had bone metastases, 46.4% had lymph node involvement and 57.1% had liver and/or lung localizations.

Whether post-therapy decline in PSA reflects true clinical benefit, and whether post-therapy declines can be used as an intermediate endpoint for accelerated drug approval is still open to question. At present, no drug has been approved strictly on the basis of a post-treatment decline in PSA, as it is unproven that such PSA changes are surrogates for true clinical benefits. Post-therapy PSA changes have been associated with improved survival in patients with castrate metastatic disease. The role of PSA changes as potential surrogates of clinical benefit have only been explored to a limited degree because to date, only two prospective randomized trials showing a survival benefit have been reported. Such trials are necessary, but not a sufficient pre-requisite to explore the potential role of any outcome measure as an intermediate endpoint. The clear demonstration that a post-therapy PSA change can account for all of the treatment effects seen is not yet available. A cytotoxic drug that does not produce any PSA decline is unlikely to be effective, but the converse is not always true because not all PSA rises represent a treatment failure. It is important to recognize that there are a range of clinical benefits to patients that can improve the quality and possibly the duration of survival, independent of PSA","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These advances generate the need for reliable molecular imaging biomarkers to non-invasively determine efficacy, and to better guide treatment selection of these promising AR-targeted drugs. Methods. We draw on our own experience, supplemented by review of the current literature, to discuss the systematic development of imaging biomarkers for use in the context of CRPC, with a focus on bone scintigraphy, F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET) and PET imaging of the AR signaling axis. Results. The roadmap to biomarker development mandates rigorous standardization and analytic validation of an assay before it can be qualified successfully for use in an appropriate clinical context. The Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 (PCWG2) criteria for 'radiographic' progression by bone scintigraphy serve as a paradigm of this process. Implemented by the Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Consortium (PCCTC), these consensus criteria may ultimately enable the co-development of more potent and versatile molecular imaging biomarkers. Purported to be superior to single-photon bone scanning, the added value of Na(18)F-PET for imaging of bone metastases is still uncertain. FDG-PET already plays an integral role in the management of many diseases, but requires further evaluation before being qualified in the context of CRPC. PET tracers that probe the AR signaling axis, such as (18)F-FDHT and (89)Zr-591, are now under development as pharmacodynamic markers, and as markers of efficacy, in tandem with FDG-PET. Semi-automated analysis programs for facilitating PET interpretation may serve as a valuable tool to help navigate the biomarker roadmap. Conclusions. Molecular imaging strategies, particularly those that probe the AR signaling axis, have the potential to accelerate drug development in CRPC. The development and use of analytically valid imaging biomarkers will increase the likelihood of clinical qualification, and ultimately lead to improved patient outcomes","","","","","","10.3109/0284186X.2011.572914 [doi]","Nuclear Medicine Service, Department of Radiology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, 1275 York Avenue, New York, NY 10065, USA. foxj@mskcc.org","PM:21604939","","","",""

As these metastases are mainly osteosclerotic and lead to a markedly increased bone calcium requirement that may give rise to an imbalance in calcium homeostasis, the authors investigated whether changes in calcium balance may be useful for evaluating the response of bone metastases to treatment. METHODS: The study involved 268 prostate carcinoma patients: 142 in Stage A-C2 (International Union Against Cancer [UICC] staging system, 1998) and 126 with bone metastases who had failed to respond to hormone therapy and were receiving chemotherapy. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA), calcium and phosphate metabolism, and the main bone formation and resorption markers were all assayed before and after chemotherapy. RESULTS: Of the 126 patients on chemotherapy, 109 were evaluable for response: according to standard criteria, 25 (23%) had improved, 43 (39.5%) were unchanged, and 41 (37.5%) had worsened. All of the improved and 16 unchanged patients had decreased PSA and bone marker levels and an increased urinary calcium/creatinine ratio (UCa/Cr); the worsened patients had increased PSA and bone marker levels, and their UCa/Cr decreased after only six treatment cycles. PSA and UCa/Cr were the biochemical markers whose changes showed the best agreement with treatment response. CONCLUSION: The UCa/Cr ratio was the most useful marker of clinical response, mainly because it allowed an early decision to continue or to stop chemotherapy. Furthermore, UCa/Cr and PSA together identified a percentage of patients classified as unchanged on the basis of standard criteria but whose condition had actually improved","","","","","","10.1002/1097-0142(20010915)92:6<1468::AID-CNCR1471>3.0.CO;2-S [pii]","Medical Oncology Division, Institute of Internal Medicine, University of Siena, Siena, Italy. francinin@unisi.it","PM:11745224","","","",""

A clinical evaluation of a novel fenestrated bone tap used in pedicle screw augmentation was performed to determine the performance and safety of this technique. METHODS: Over a 2.5-year period, the clinical and radiographic results of 119 consecutive patients who underwent instrumented arthrodesis were reviewed. Of these patients, 23 had bone softening secondary to osteoporosis and/or metastatic spinal tumor involvement. These patients underwent surgical decompression and spinal instrumentation. RESULTS: Six patients (26%) had metastatic spine disease (squamous cell lung carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, bladder carcinoma, breast, prostate, and uterine adenocarcinoma); five patients (22%) had a degenerative spondylolisthesis; and 12 patients (52%) had burst fractures, eight as a result of benign causes and four as a result of metastatic disease. Four (17%) patients underwent revision surgery of previous pedicle screw failure resulting from bone softening and pseudarthrosis. A total of 98 levels were fused using 158 polymethylmethacrylate-augmented screws. None of the patients experienced operative death, myocardial infarction, hypoxemia, intraoperative hypotension, radiculopathy, or myelopathy. Asymptomatic anterior cement extravasation was observed in nine patients (39%). There was one asymptomatic polymethylmethacrylate pulmonary embolus and one wound infection. There was no significant relationship between cement extravasation and the quantity used, levels augmented, or location (P > 0.05). There were no construct failures. CONCLUSION: Polymethylmethacrylate-augmented pedicle screw fixation reduces the likelihood of pedicle screw loosening and pullout in patients with osteoporosis requiring instrumented arthrodesis","","","","","","10.1227/01.NEU.0000290899.15567.68 [doi];00006123-200709000-00013 [pii]","Department of Neurosurgery, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina 29425, USA. frankel@musc.edu","PM:17881965","","","",""

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of carbon-11 acetate and (18)F-FDG PET in the detection of prostate cancer and its metastases. Twenty-five patients were investigated during the follow-up of primary prostate cancer, suspected relapse or metastatic disease using (11)C-acetate PET; 15 of these patients were additionally investigated using (18)F-FDG PET. Fourteen patients were receiving anti-androgen treatment at the time of the investigation. Lesions were detected in 20/24 (83%) patients using (11)C-acetate PET and in 10/15 (75%) patients using (18)F-FDG PET. Based on the results of both PET scans, one patient was diagnosed with recurrent lung cancer. Median (18)F-FDG uptake exceeded that of (11)C-acetate in distant metastases (SUV =3.2 vs 2.3). However, in local recurrence and in regional lymph node metastases, (11)C-acetate uptake (median SUVs =2.9 and 3.8, respectively) was higher than that of (18)F-FDG (median SUVs =1.0 and 1.1, respectively). A positive correlation was observed between serum PSA level and both (11)C-acetate uptake and (18)F-FDG uptake. (11)C-acetate seems more useful than (18)F-FDG in the detection of local recurrences and regional lymph node metastases. (18)F-FDG, however, appears to be more accurate in visualising distant metastases. There may be a role for combined (11)C-acetate/(18)F-FDG PET in the follow-up of patients with prostate cancer and persisting or increasing PSA","","","","","","10.1007/s00259-002-1104-y [doi]","Department of Nuclear Medicine, Hannover Medical School, Carl-Neuberg-Strasse 1, 30625, Hannover, Germany. efricke@hdz-nrw.de","PM:12589476","","","",""

Methods and Materials: There were 5 consecutive patients with bone metastases from nonseminomatous germ cell tumors treated between 2003 and 2006 who underwent imaging studies, including MRI. The characteristic imaging findings are discussed in the light of the clinical course. Results: Of the 5 patients, 3 had symptoms related to bone involvement at diagnosis. All patients received conventional x-ray of their bony lesions, but only 1 of them was considered abnormal. Skeletal MRI was obtained in all patients. A bone scan was available in 3 cases with spinal involvement. It was normal in 1 case and detected only a mi nority of the lesions visible on MRI in the other 2 cases. Follow-up MRIs were available in all patients. A partial resolution of bone involvement during chemotherapy was observed in only 1 of them. In 2 cases, there was a slight progression of a diffuse alteration of the bone marrow during treatment. In 1 patient, severe spinal bone marrow changes were visible on MRI 2 years after cessation of treatment without evidence of disease recurrence. Conclusions: MRI may disclose bone metastases in nonseminomatous germ cell tumors, which otherwise may be missed. MRI findings of bone lesions during treatment do not directly reflect the course of the disease and have to be interpreted with caution using clinical information. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Materials and methods: A total of 25 PC patients with biochemical failure (mean PSA value 11.1 ng/mL; median value 6.3 ng/mL; range 0.2-37.7 ng/mL) after primary treatment were included in this retrospective study. All of them showed a single lesion on BS reported as suspected for metastatic lesion or as equivocal finding. Patients underwent SUP 11 C-choline PET/CT within 1-4 months from BS. Validation was established by follow-up for at least 6 months. Results: On the basis of biopsy confirmation and/or 6-month follow-up, 22 of 25 patients were classified as positive for the presence of met astatic bone lesions: 13 with a single lesion and 9 with multiple lesions. SUP 11 C-choline PET/CT was positive in 19/25 patients and, on a lesion basis, it showed 50 positive findings. BS results were confirmed in 8/25 (32%) patients. SUP 11 C-choline PET/CT detected multiple sites of relapse in 11/25 (44%) patients: in 2/11, a single bone lesion associated with other extraosseous sites of relapse; in 6/11, multiple bone lesions; in 3/11, multiple bone lesions and other extraosseous localizations. Finally, 6/25 patients were negative on SUP 11 C-choline PET/CT. In 3/6 patients, an osteoblastic lesion was seen on CT attenuation correction images (PET false negative; BS true positive), while in 3/6 patients only findings suggestive of the pr esence of degenerative disease were found (PET true negative; BS false positive). On a patient basis, SUP 11 C-choline PET/CT showed a diagnostic sensitivity of 86% (19/22) and a specificity of 100% (19/19). Conclusions: In our study, SUP 11 C-choline PET/CT detected unknown lesions in 11/25 patients. Patients with a single equivocal finding on BS could have important additional information from SUP 11 C-choline PET/CT study, especially in the detection of additional metastases, to choose an appropriate treatment.

Ninty-one prostate cancer patients underwent bone scintigraphy, and urine NTx/creatinine (NTx/Cr) was measured. Urine NTx/Cr levels were compared with bone scintigraphic results. Urine NTx/Cr levels in the bone metastasis-positive group (n = 47) were 92.9 +/- 105.1 nmol/L of bone collagen, which is equivalent to per millimole of urinary creatinine (nmol/L BCE/mmol/L Cr), significantly higher than the level of the bone metastasis-negative group (n = 44) (59.0 +/- 41.6 nmol/L BCE/mmol/L Cr). When patients were classified by the extent of disease grade (EOD grade) nomenclature, the urine NTx/Cr level of the EOD (4+) group was 209.5 +/- 186.5 nmol/L BCE/mmol/L Cr. This level was significantly higher than those of the EOD (-) group (59.0 +/- 41.6 nmol/L BCE/mmol/L Cr), EOD (1+) group (59.0 +/- 47.8 nmol/L BCE/mmol/L Cr), and EOD (2+) group (81.1 +/- 41.3 nmol/L BCE/mmol/L Cr). However, no significant difference was observed between the EOD (-) and EOD (1+) groups. The mean change in urine NTx/Cr level 3 to 17 months after the first bone scintigraphy and urine NTx/Cr examination in the bone metastasis-progression group (n = 8) was 11.0 +/- 31.2 nmol/L BCE/mmol/L Cr, significantly higher than that in the bone metastasis-regression group (n = 15) (-26.8 +/- 40.7 nmol/L BCE/mmol/L Cr). In conclusion, urine NTx /Cr can be measured noninvasively and reflects the state of bone metastasis. However, the sensitivity of urine NTx/Cr is not as high as that of bone scintigraphy. Therefore, it may provide an auxiliary diagnostic index for bone scintigraphy","","","","","","S002604950200001X [pii]","Department of Radiology, Jikei University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan","PM:12077723","","","",""

In sixty-nine patients with prostate cancer, bone scintigraphy was performed, and serum PSA and PICP and urine NTx were measured. The median level of serum PSA in the osseous metastasis-negative group (n = 33) was 0.80 ng/ml being significantly lower as compared to the osseous metastasis-positive group (n = 36, 7.70 ng/ml) (p < 0.0001). The serum PICP and urine NTx/Cr levels appeared lower in the osseous metastasis-negative group than the osseous metastasis-positive group, but there was no significant difference. Logistic regression analysis showed that ability to diagnose skeletal metastasis of serum PSA was 68.1% and superior to those of serum PICP (56.5%) and urine NTx/Cr (53.6%). Serum PSA improved the ability to diagnose skeletal metastasis when combined with serum PICP or urine NTx/Cr. When patients were grouped according to the extent of disease grade (EOD grade) nomenclature, Spearman's correlation coefficient by rank showed that serum PSA was most significantly correlated with EOD grade (p < 0.0001). In 14 patients whose skeletal metastases progressed or regressed, the change of serum PSA more clearly separated the osseous metastasis-regression group and osseous metastasis-progression group than did serum PICP and urine NTx/Cr.

Patients and Methods: Patients were randomly assigned to receive ixabepilone (35 mg/m SUP 2) by intravenous infusion every 3 weeks with or without EMP 280 mg orally three times daily on days 1 to 5. Results: Between December 2001 and October 2003, 92 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to treatment with ixabepilone alone (45 patients) or in combination with EMP (47 patients). Grades 3 and 4 toxicities experienced by more than 5% of patients included neutropenia (22%), fatigue (9%), and neuropathy (13%) on the ixabepilone arm, and neutropenia (29%), febrile neutropenia (9%), fatigue (9%), neuropathy (7%), and thrombosis (6%) on the ixabepilone + EMP arm. Post-treatment declines in prostate-specific antigen of >= 50% were achieved in 21 of 44 patients (48%; 95% CI, 33% to 64%) on the ixabepilone arm, and 31 of 45 patients (69%; 95% CI, 55% to 82%) on the ixabepilone + EMP arm. In patients with measurable disease, partial responses were observed in eight of 25 patients (32%; 95% CI, 14% to 50%) on the ixabepilone arm, and 11 of 23 (48%; 95% CI, 27% to 68%) on the ixabepilone + EMP arm. Time to prostate-specific antigen progression was 4.4 months (95% CI, 3.1 to 6.9 months) on the ixabepilone-alone arm and 5.2 months (95% CI, 4.5 to 6.8 months) on the combination arm. Conclusion: Ixabepilone, with or without estramustine phosphate, is well tolerated and has antitumor activity in patients with castrate metastatic prostate cancer","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To improve outcomes, numerous studies have evaluated docetaxel in combination with other agents. Here, results for docetaxel-based combination therapy in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) are reviewed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Relevant studies were identified in databases of published literature, clinical trials, and conference abstracts using the search terms docetaxel and prostate, with additional searches carried out for identified agents. RESULTS: Numerous classes of agents have been combined with docetaxel in phase II studies in CRPC, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors, antiangiogenic agents, bone-targeted agents, BCL-2 inhibitors, chemotherapies, immunologic agents, and vitamin D analogs. In several cases, promising rates of prostate-specific antigen response, tumor response, and survival have been reported. However, some combinations have caused increased toxicity. Phase III trials with docetaxel plus GVAX or DN-101 were terminated because of lower survival; phase III trials with docetaxel plus bevacizumab, aflibercept, dasatinib, zibotentan, atrasentan, or lenalidomide are ongoing. CONCLUSIONS: Docetaxel-based doublet therapy remains an active investigational strategy in CRPC. Further phase III data are awaited to determine whether survival can be extended compared with docetaxel alone","","","","","","mdq050 [pii];10.1093/annonc/mdq050 [doi]","Comprehensive Cancer Centers of Nevada, Las Vegas, NV 89169, USA.

This study examined the impact of a combined resistance and aerobic exercise program as a countermeasure to these AST-related toxicities. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 2007 and 2008, 57 patients with prostate cancer undergoing AST (commenced > 2 months prior) were randomly assigned to a program of resistance and aerobic exercise (n = 29) or usual care (n = 28) for 12 weeks. Primary end points were whole body and regional lean mass. Secondary end points were muscle strength and function, cardiorespiratory capacity, blood biomarkers, and quality of life. RESULTS: Analysis of covariance was used to compare outcomes for groups at 12 weeks adjusted for baseline values and potential confounders. Patients undergoing exercise showed an increase in lean mass compared with usual care (total body, P = .047; upper limb, P < .001; lower limb, P = .019) and similarly better muscle strength (P < .01), 6-meter walk time (P = .024), and 6-meter backward walk time (P = .039). Exercise also improved several aspects of quality of life including general health (P = .022) and reduced fatigue (P = .021) and decreased levels of C-reactive protein (P = .008). There were no adverse events during the testing or exercise intervention program. CONCLUSION: A relatively brief exposure to exercise significantly improved muscle mass, strength, physical function, and balance in hypogonadal men compared with normal care. The exercise regimen was well tolerated and could be recommended for patients undergoing AST as an effective countermeasure to these common treatment-related adverse effects","","","","","","JCO.2009.23.2488 [pii];10.1200/JCO.2009.23.2488 [doi]","School of Exercise, Biomedical and Health Sciences, Edith Cowan University, 100 Joondalup Dr, Joondalup, Western Australia 6027, Australia. d.galvao@ecu.edu.au","PM:19949016","","","",""

Gemcitabine is a nucleoside analogue with broad antitumor activity. In a phase 2 study of combined docetaxel and gemcitabine, the authors assessed its safety and activity in patients with chemotherapy-naive, metastatic CRPC. METHODS: Eligible patients had untreated, metastatic CRPC with radiologic and/or biochemical evidence of progression after antiandrogen withdrawal with castrate testosterone levels, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology performance status (ECOG PS) of 0 to 2, and adequate organ function; no previous chemotherapy was permitted. Patients received gemcitabine (800 mg/m(2)) Days 1 and 8 and docetaxel (75 mg/m(2)) on Day 8 every 21 days for a maximum of 6 cycles. Response was evaluated using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) for measurable disease. A prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response was defined as a decline >/= 50% in baseline PSA level. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients with chemotherapy-naive, metastatic CRPC were enrolled. The median age was 67 years, and 60% of patients had an ECOG PS of 0. PSA responses were observed in 49% of patients. Among the patients who had measurable disease (n = 25), 3 patients (12%) had a confirmed, RECIST-defined partial response (PR); 4 patients (16%) had an unconfirmed PR; and 15 patients (60%) achieved stable disease. The most common adverse events included grade 1 and 2 fatigue (69%), alopecia (80%), and nausea/vomiting (54%). No treatment-related deaths were noted, but an unusually high incidence of grade 3 and 4 neutropenia was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of combined gemcitabine and docetaxel in metastatic CRPC was similar to that observed with single-agent docetaxel. In contrast to single-agent docetaxel, the combination was moderately toxic and had an impact primarily on bone marrow reserve","","","","","","10.1002/cncr.25457 [doi]","Department of Solid Tumor Oncology, Cleveland Clinic Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland, Ohio, USA. garciaj4@cff.org","PM:20922803","","","",""

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty-eight patients with increased PSA levels (0.8-9.5 ng/ml) after radical treatment for prostate cancer (surgery n = 20/radiation therapy n = 18) were included. Ten patients were on hormone therapy. All patients underwent a PET/CT with (11)C-choline and (18)F-FDG, respectively, on the same day. The PET imaging findings were compared with histopathology (n = 10); PSA monitoring (n = 21) and/ or other methods (n = 7). RESULTS: Focal uptake of (11)C-choline was detected in 26 patients (68%), and focal uptake of (18)F-FDG was detected in 13 patients (34%). The (11)C-choline uptake in 14 patients was suggested local recurrence, whereas this was true in only 4 patients (48%) with (18)F-FDG. Pelvic lymph nodes were detected with (11)C-choline PET/CT in 8 patients and only in 4 patients (50%) with (18)F-FDG. Mediastinal involvement was detected in 5 patients with (11)C-choline and 3 patients (60%) with (18)F-FDG. Focal bone involvement was detected in 3 patients with (11)C-choline and (18)F-FDG. (11)C-choline was able to detect 40% of recurrences in patients with PSA < 1 ng/ml, 50% of recurrences in patients with PSA 1-4 ng/ml and 87% of recurrences with PSA > 4 ng/ml. Sensitivity of (11)C-choline was higher for surgically treated patients, with no significant differences found between patients with and without hormone therapy. CONCLUSIONS: (11)C-choline PET/CT was useful for the detection of biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer, with higher yielding as compared to (18)F-FDG. (11)C-choline sensitivity was clearly related to PSA levels, was higher in patients with surgery and did not seem to be modified by hormonal therapy. Disease staging with (11)C-choline showed direct impact for the selection of the most appropriate therapeutic approach","","","","","","13137968 [pii]","CETIR Unitat PET, Esplugues de Llobregat, Barcelona, Espana. jrgarcia@cetir.es","PM:19558948","","","",""

The aim of this study was to compare the clinical utility of new bone resorption markers to that of bone formation in patients with bone metastases from prostate cancer before and after bisphosphonate treatment. Thirty-nine patients with prostate cancer and bone metastasis, nine patients with prostate cancer without bone metastases, nine patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia and 355 healthy age-matched men were included. Urinary non-isomerized (alpha CTX) and beta isomerized (beta CTX) type I collagen C-telopeptides (CTX) and a new assay for serum CTX were used to assess bone resorption. Bone formation was determined by serum osteocalcin, serum total (T-ALP) and bone (BAP) alkaline phosphatase and serum type I collagen C-terminal propeptide (PICP). Fourteen patients with bone metastases were also evaluated 15 days after a single injection of the bisphosphonate pamidronate (120 mg). Levels of all bone formation and bone resorption markers were significantly (P < 0.006-0.0001) higher in patients with prostate cancer and bone metastasis than in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia, patients with prostate cancer without bone metastases and healthy controls. In patients with bone metastases the median was increased by 67% for serum osteocalcin, 128% for T-ALP, 138% for BAP, 79% for PICP, 220% for urinary alpha CTX, 149% for urinary beta CTX and 214% for serum CTX. After bisphosphonate treatment all three resorption markers significantly decreased by an average of 65% (P = 0.001), 71% (P = 0.0010) and 61% (P = 0.0015) for urinary alpha CTX, urinary beta CTX and serum CTX, respectively, whereas no significant change was observed for any bone formation markers. Patients with prostate cancer and bone metastases exhibit a marked increase in bone resorption, which decreases within a few days of treatment with pamidronate. These findings suggest that these new resorption markers may be useful for the management of these patients. (C) 2000 Cancer Research Campaign","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The IGF family plays a key role in cellular metabolism, differentiation, proliferation, transformation and apoptosis, during normal development and malignant growth. This family also seem essential in prostate cancer bone metastases, angiogenesis and andro gen-independent progression. Therapeutic alternatives in men with progressive prostate cancer after androgen ablation are very limited. More effective therapies are needed for these patients. Pharmacologic interventions targeting the IGF family are being devised. Such strategies include reduction of IGF-I levels (growth hormone-releasing hormone antagonists, somatostatin analogs), reduction of functional IGF-I receptor levels (antisense oligonucleotides, small interfering RNA), inhibition of IGF-IR and its signalling (monoclonal antibodies, small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors) and Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Proteins.

The success of imatinib mesylate (Gleevec; Novartis Pharmaceuticals, East Hanover, NJ), a small molecule that inhibits the activation of the BCR-Abl oncogene in the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia, has demonstrated how effective targeted strategies can be when properly applied. With the hope of selectively targeting other critical components of cancer growth and survival while minimizing toxicity to the host, numerous strategies have been developed to inhibit receptor tyrosine kinases for various growth factors commonly expressed by cancer cells. Success of targeted inhibitors is inherently dependent on the proper selection of patients whose tumors are dependent on these growth factor pathways. Unfortunately, in prostate cancer, such selection has been a difficult-to-impossible task to date. Because of the vast number of mutational events, it is difficult to demonstrate that any particular growth factor signaling pathway is critical. In addition, because of the type (mostly bone only) and nature (usually small foci) of metastases, limited access to tumor tissue in the advanced cancer population has hampered attempts to characterize patients by their molecular features or phenotype. This article will focus on defining alternative criteria for a rational drug target and novel study designs for testing these agents in prostate cancer.

Recent reports suggest benefit from decompressive surgery. OBJECTIVES: To determine effectiveness and adverse effects of radiotherapy, surgery and corticosteroids in MESCC. SEARCH STRATEGY: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, LILACS and CANCERLIT were searched; last search ran July 2008 SELECTION CRITERIA: We selected randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of radiotherapy, surgery and corticosteroids in adults with MESCC. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Three review authors independently assessed quality of included studies and extracted data. We calculated risk ratios (RR) and numbers needed to treat to benefit (NNT) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and assessed heterogeneity. MAIN RESULTS: We identified six trials (n = 544). One trial (n = 276) compared radiotherapy 30 Gray in eight fractions with 16 Gray in two fractions and showed no difference. Overall ambulatory rates were 71% versus 68%, (RR 1.02, CI 0.90 to 1.15); 91% versus 89% of ambulant patients maintained ambulation (RR 1.02, CI 0.93 to 1.12); 28% versus 29% of non-ambulant patients regained ambulation (RR 0.98, CI 0.51 to 1.88). In one trial (n = 101) decompressive surgery had significantly better outcomes than radiotherapy in selected patients. Overall ambulatory rates were 84% versus 57% (RR 0.67, CI 0.53 to 0.86, NNT 3.70 CI 2.38 to 7.69); 94% versus 74% maintained ambulation (RR 0.79, CI 0.64 to 0.98, NNT 5.00 CI 2.78 to 33.33); 63% versus 19% regained ambulation (RR 0.30, CI 0.10 to 0.89; NNT 2.27 CI 1.35 to 7.69). Median survival was 126 days versus 100 days. Laminectomy offered no advantage (n = 29, 1 trial). Three trials provided insufficient evidence about the role of corticosteroids (n = 105, Overall ambulation RR 0.91, CI 0.68 to 1.23). Serious adverse effects were significantly higher in high dose corticosteroid arms (n = 77, two RCTs, RR 0.12, CI 0.02 to 0.97). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Patients with stable spines retaining the ability to walk may be treated with radiotherapy. One trial indicates that short course radiotherapy suffices in patients with unfavourable histologies or predicted survival of less than six months. There is some evidence of benefit from decompressive surgery in ambulant patients with poor prognostic factors for radiotherapy; and in non-ambulant patients with a single area of compression, paraplegia < 48 hours, non-radiosensitive tumours and a predicted survival of more than three months. High dose corticosteroids carry a significant risk of serious adverse effects. INTERVENTIONS FOR THE TREATMENT OF METASTATIC EXTRADURAL SPINAL CORD COMPRESSION: Cancer that spreads to the spine can compress the spinal cord and nearby spinal structures. If this is not treated, it can lead to pain, disability (including paraplegia) and incontinence. Radiotherapy, steroids and different surgical techniques have been used to reduce the pressure on the spinal cord. It is important to select patients carefully for the different types of treatments as the prognosis and outcome vary greatly depending on the type of cancer and the stage of the illness. This review included trials of radiotherapy, surgery, and steroids to assess if these treatments helped improve walking ability. One study showed that in some common cancers, or where survival was expected to be short, two radiotherapy treatments a week apart were as effective as longer courses of radiation treatment. Another trial showed that with decompressive surgery before radiotherapy compared to radiotherapy alone, more patients maintained the ability to walk and more patients regained their ability to walk. Survival in the radiotherapy alone group was 100 days versus 126 days in those who had surgery first. An older trial reported no additional benefit with the surgical procedure of laminectomy before radiotherapy. It is difficult to give definite recommendations based on these few trials which included a relatively small number of patients, and had different selection criteria. Radiotherapy will be required in the majority of patients, with better results seen in those who have not lost walking ability. Carefully selected patients with a single site of cord compression, who are fit for surgery and have not been paraplegic for more than 48 hours may be considered for decompressive surgery before radiotherapy. High doses of steroids (96 to 100 mg of dexamethasone) significantly increased the risk of serious side effects as compared to moderate doses of 10 to 16 mg dexamethasone or placebo","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We report our experience with the safety and efficacy of salvage cryosurgery using the argon based CRYOCare system (Endocare, Inc, Irvine, California). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between October 1997 and September 2000, 38 men with a mean age of 71.9 years underwent salvage cryosurgery for recurrent prostate cancer after radiation therapy failed. All patients had biochemical disease recurrence, defined as an increase in prostate specific antigen (PSA) of greater than 0.3 ng./ml. above the post-radiation PSA nadir. Subsequently prostate biopsy was positive for cancer. Pre-cryosurgery bone scan demonstrated no evidence of metastatic disease. In addition, these patients received 3 months of neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy before cryotherapy. RESULTS: The PSA nadir was 0.1 or less, 1 or less and greater than 1 ng./ml. in 31 (81.5%), 5 (13.2%) and 2 (5.3%) patients, respectively. Biochemical recurrence-free survival calculated from Kaplan-Meier curves was 86% at 1 year and 74% at 2 years. Reported complications included rectal pain in 39.5% of cases, urinary tract infection in 2.6%, incontinence in 7.9%, hematuria in 7.9% and scrotal edema in 10.5%. The rate of rectourethral fistula, urethral sloughing and urinary retention was 0%. CONCLUSIONS: Our study supports cryosurgery of the prostate as safe and effective treatment in patients in whom radiation therapy fails. Using the CRYOCare machine resulted in a marked decrease in complications","","","","","","S0022-5347(05)65763-1 [pii]","Department of Urology, College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University, New York, New York, USA","PM:11547068","","","",""

All were taking analgesics daily (nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs/opiates). Re-186-HEDP (mean 35.2 mCi) was administered and patients were monitored for at least 50 days. In five patients, a repeat dose was administered 9 to 10 weeks later. The evaluation of the analgesic effect was based on a 'pain diary' and by recording the use of analgesics. In 80% (20 of 25) of the patients, the effect was significant palliation, moderate in 3 patients (12%), and insignificant in 2 (8%). No significant myelotoxicity was observed. Transient pain flare was recorded in 8 of 25 patients.

A novel method using molecular, polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based detection of CCC was applied for predicting prostate cancer and to assess the effect of radical prostatectomy (RP) on reducing CCC and for prognostication of relapse-free survival (RFS), as serum total prostate-specific antigen (tPSA) has limited specificity at 4-10 ng/mL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In all, 240 patients were enrolled in the study, 129 for tumour diagnosis and 111 after RP for disease prognostication. Filtration assay in previously fractionated mononuclear cells (MNC) was used to enrich the CCC and large cells, which were retained in a mesh of 20 microm width. To establish the malignant nature of these cells they were analysed for genomic imbalances detected via PCR-assays of loss of heterozygosity in tumour suppressor loci and of DNA amplification in protooncogen loci. As a screening test in daily practice, real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR of AOX was introduced to overcome the laborious and expensive DNA tests. The AOX chosen were glutathione peroxidase (GPX1), Mn-dependent superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) and thioredoxine reductase (TXNRD1); selected from 67 marker candidate genes according to sensitivity and specificity data. AOX overexpression in CCC serves as a general marker for solid tumours needing, however, organ markers to relate to the organ of origin. Androgen receptor (AR), PSA and prostate-specific membrane antigen mRNAs served as organ markers for the prostate. Signals were detected in patients' MNC and to a minor level in CCC, rendering to CCC a substantial loss in epithelial features equivalent to a lower grade of epithelial differentiation. Organ markers in the MNC fraction were positive in <85% of AOX testing. RESULTS: The AOX test was tumour predicting (P < 0.001) with a sensitivity of 86%, specificity 82%, positive predictive value 69%, negative predictive value 92%, accuracy 83% and odds ratio (OR) of 28. SOD2 and TXNRD1 expression correlated to tumour size and Gleason score. Objective assessment for the evaluation of the molecular cell markers was achieved by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The areas under the ROC curve values of the AOXs were 0.7-0.9. RP was followed by a complete clearance of AOX-expressing cells. After RP, a subgroup of patients had residual CCC over-expressing only SOD2 and GPX1 indicating incomplete clearance by RP. Sustained overexpression of SOD2 and GPX1 accounted as risk factors for distant tumour recurrence (P = 0.003) mainly for bone metastases (97% M1b) as evaluated by Kaplan-Meier curves. In univariate analysis the tumour size had a limited effect on the probability of RFS (P = 0.05). In multivariate analysis tumour size, nodal status and Gleason score had no effect. This can partially be attributed to the higher risk level of pathological variables in the AOX over-expressing group but also to ineffective endocrine therapy resulting in marked overexpression of ARs and GPX1, the lead prognosticator gene. The AOX expression level allowed the identification of patients with high progression risk, who have more favourable pathological variables. CONCLUSION: The AOX testing of CCC is a novel method with excellent prognostic and predictive properties enabling the monitoring of therapies, e.g. effects of RP and endocrine therapy. We speculate that the continuing elevated expression of AOX with special emphasis on GPX1 acts as survival and defence mechanism in CCC required in an atypical environment prone to escape from immune surveillance","","","","","","BJU8920 [pii];10.1111/j.1464-410X.2009.08920.x [doi]","Institute for Molecular Nanotechnology, Recklinghausen, Germany. giesing@onkokonsult.com","PM:19818074","","","",""

We focused on the current management and novel investigational strategies for the chemonaive patient population with castration resistant metastatic disease. Materials and Methods: We reviewed standard and investigational hormonal, chemotherapeutic, biological and immune based strategies for patients with castration resistant metastatic prostate cancer who have not yet received taxane based chemotherapy. Results: Our understanding of the natural history of this group of patients is evolving. A variety of standard and experimental treatment options are available for this group of patients. Manipulating the androgen receptor signaling axis, targeting antiapoptotic pathways, using antiangiogenic strategies, harnessing the immune system and optimizing docetaxel based regimens and novel cytotoxic agents are under investigation. Conclusions: Multiple agents currently under development offer a promise of palliation and prolongation of survival above and beyond that of docetaxel. In the absence of guidance from randomized trials with regard to chemotherapy timing, and considering the modest effects of docetaxel on survival, decisions regarding choice of therapy (standard chemotherapy or experimental therapies) must be based on careful consideration of the functional status of each individual, presence of symptoms, comorbidities and overall therapeutic objectives.

Because of the osseous distribution of prostate cancer metastases, progression is more readily identified than response in prostate cancer clinical trials. As a result, there is an increased focus on progression-free survival (PFS) as a phase 2 endpoint. PFS, however, is vulnerable to inter-study design variability. The authors sought to identify and quantify this variability and the resultant error in PFS across prostate cancer clinical trials. METHODS. The authors reviewed phase 2 clinical trials of cytotoxic agents in castration-resistant metastatic prostate cancer over 5 years to evaluate the policies determining extent of disease and the definitions of disease progression. A simulation model was created to define the degree of error in estimating PFS in 3 hypothetical cohorts (median PFS of 12, 24, and 36 weeks) when the frequency of outcome assessments varies. RESULTS. Imaging policies for trial entry were heterogeneous, as were the type, timing, and indications for outcome assessments. In the simulation, error in the reported PFS varied according to the interval between assessments. The difference between the detected and the true PFS could vary as much as 6.4 weeks per cycle, strictly resulting from the variability of assessment schedules tested. CONCLUSIONS. Outcome assessment policies are highly variable in phase 2 studies of castration-resistant prostate cancer patients, despite published guidelines designed to standardize authentication of disease progression. The estimated error in PFS can exceed 6 weeks per cycle, exclusively because of variations in the assessment schedules. Comparisons of PFS times from different studies must be made with circumspection. (c) 2008 American Cancer Society","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Summary: Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy in men in the United States. Many prostate cancer patients, especially those with aggressive and advanced disease, are at increased risk of developing bone metastases and, subsequently, skeletal-related events. Skeletal-related events may result both from disease and/or treatment of disease, and include bone pain, pathological fractures and spinal cord compressions. Furthermore, bone radiation and surgery to address bone-related pain, prevent pathological fractures and/or spinal cord compression are also considered skeletal-related events. These sequelae of bone metastases are both painful and debilitating, and severely compromise a patient's quality of life","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In addition, recent trials describing therapeutic intervention for prostate cancer-associated osteoporosis will be reviewed briefly. Osteoporosis has become an increasingly important problem in men's health, accounting for significant morbidity in the aging United States male population. Hypogonadism is a major risk factor. Patients treated with androgen deprivation therapy for advanced or metastatic prostate cancer are at risk for both hypogonadism and osteoporosis. These patients may suffer additional morbidity from decreased bone mineralization, such as skeletal fracture. There is a direct association with fracture and decreased quality of life and increased mortality. Male osteoporosis is an important clinical entity, particular in aging men and in men with prostate cancer treated with androgen deprivation therapy.

Men suffer excess morbidity and mortality after clinically significant fractures and may be at risk for undertreatment. Moreover, fracture is associated with decreased overall survival in men who have prostate cancer. Bisphosphonates inhibit osteoclast activity and have been shown to be beneficial in multiple myeloma and in patients who have lytic bone lesions secondary to breast cancer. Several randomized clinical trials have assessed the efficacy of bisphosphonate therapy in patients who have advanced and metastatic prostate cancer. The current evidence suggests that bisphosphonates reduce bone turnover and increase or maintain BMD in patients treated with ADT. Fracture rates have not been formally studied with randomized clinical trials; however, the stabilization of BMD theoretically should decrease the risk of fracture in this population of men. Despite these findings, bisphosphonate therapy has not become standard clinical practice in managing these men. In fact, a recent review of 184 patients who had prostate cancer treated with ADT for >1 year revealed that only 8.7% were evaluated with DEXA scan, and only 5.4% were treated with bisphosphonates [56]. Although further research and formal recommendations are needed, patients placed on androgen deprivation should be counseled regarding preventative measures, and BMD measurement should be strongly considered. Administration of bisphosphonate therapy should be instituted in cases with clinical evidence of decreased BMD or fracture. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

The role of other clinical and pathological variables has not been explored. METHODS: A total of 2,124 prostate cancer patients referred to our Institution for [(11)C]choline PET/CT from December 2004 to January 2007 for restaging of disease were retrospectively considered for this study. Inclusion criteria were: previous treatment by radical prostatectomy, and biochemical failure, defined as at least two consecutive PSA measurements of >0.2 ng/ml. These criteria were met for 358 patients. Binary logistic analysis was used to investigate the predictive factors of [(11)C]choline PET/CT. PET/CT findings were validated using criteria based on histological analysis, and follow-up clinical and imaging data. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to assess the performance of [(11)C]choline PET/CT in relation to PSA levels. RESULTS: The mean PSA level was 3.77 +/- 6.94 ng/ml (range 0.23-45 ng/ml; median 1.27 ng/ml). PET/CT was positive for recurrence in 161 of 358 patients (45%). On an anatomical region basis, [(11)C]choline pathological uptake was observed in lymph nodes (107/161 patients, 66%), prostatectomy bed (55/161 patients, 34%), and in the skeleton (46/161 patients, 29%). PET/CT findings were validated using histological criteria (46/358, 13%), and follow-up clinical and imaging criteria (312/358, 87%). Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and overall accuracy were, respectively, 85%, 93%, 91%, 87%, and 89%. In multivariate analysis, high PSA levels, advanced pathological stage, previous biochemical failure and older age were significantly (P < 0.05) associated with an increased risk of positive PET/CT findings. The percentage of positive scans was 19% in those with a PSA level between 0.2 and 1 ng/ml, 46% in those with a PSA level between 1 and 3 ng/ml, and 82% in those with a PSA level higher than 3 ng/ml. ROC analysis showed that PET/CT-positive and PET/CT-negative patients could be best distinguished using a PSA cut-off value of 1.4 ng/ml. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to PSA levels, pathological stage, previous biochemical failure and age should be considered by physicians when referring prostate cancer patients with biochemical failure after radical prostatectomy to [(11)C]choline PET/CT","","","","","","10.1007/s00259-009-1253-3 [doi]","Center for Molecular Bioimaging, University of Milano-Bicocca, Milano, Italy","PM:19756592","","","",""

METHODS: The debate was framed within the context of known toxicities of therapy and impact on quality of life. Arguments for and against IAS were summarized. RESULTS: IAS appears to be a reasonable treatment approach for men with advanced prostate cancer except those with high risk features including PSA > 20, or bone metastatic disease. Men with TxN1-3M0 who are sexually active, compliant to close follow-up, or who do not tolerate the side effects of androgen ablation can be considered for IAS as long as they realize it is investigational. There is not a clear consensus upon duration of treatment, interval between treatment cycles, or appropriate PSA nadir, but it does appear that PSA nadir > 4 ng/ml may predict a poor outcome. Based on time to PSA nadir and changes in expression of proliferation markers staining, treatment duration of 6 to 9 months is recommended prior to stopping therapy. Trigger points for restarting therapy are individualized, and factors that are considered include pretreatment PSA levels, stage, PSA velocity, presence of symptoms, and tolerance of androgen ablation therapy. CONCLUSIONS: IAS should be considered in the management of men with advanced prostate cancer and no evidence of bone metastases. While intermittent therapy is feasible and offers potential improvement in quality of life, it is not yet shown that it reverses the long-term side effects of androgen suppression","","","","","","S1078-1439(08)00183-X [pii];10.1016/j.urolonc.2008.07.025 [doi]","Department of Urology, Vancouver General Hospital, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada","PM:19111804","","","",""

Zoledronic acid (intravenous; 4 mg monthly) is approved to prevent skeletal-related events (SREs) in patients with bone metastases from several tumor types, and can improve survival in some subsets of patients with skeletal metastases and high baseline bone turnover. In the adjuvant setting, bisphosphonates have shown clinical efficacy for preventing cancer treatment-induced bone loss and promise for reducing disease recurrence. For example, early studies of clodronate showed the potential for bisphosphonates to prevent bone metastases and prolong survival, but results with clodronate have been inconsistent. Recently, the more active bisphosphonate zoledronic acid (4 mg every 6 months) prevented bone loss and significantly reduced the risk of disease-free survival events by 36% (P = .01) compared with adjuvant endocrine therapy alone in a large phase III trial (N = 1,803) in premenopausal women with early breast cancer. Notably, these benefits were not limited to bone, because the addition of zoledronic acid reduced disease recurrence at all sites. Similarly, twice-yearly zoledronic acid has reduced disease recurrence in large phase III trials in more than 1,600 postmenopausal women with early breast cancer. Several ongoing trials (involving more than 20,000 patients altogether) are evaluating the efficacy of bisphosphonates for prevention of metastases in breast, prostate, and lung cancers; and multiple myeloma. Results from these studies are likely to expand the role of bisphosphonates, especially zoledronic acid, in the adjuvant therapy setting","","","","","","","Department of Surgery, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria. michael.gnant@meduniwien.ac.at","PM:20025570","","","",""

There are a limited number of reviews evaluating interventions for fatigue during active treatment, and they are restricted to patients with advanced cancer, or to patients during radiotherapy. To date there is no systematic review on psychosocial interventions for fatigue during cancer treatment. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate if psychosocial interventions are effective in reducing fatigue in cancer patients receiving active treatment for cancer, and which types of psychosocial interventions are the most effective. SEARCH STRATEGY: In September 2008 we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library), PUBMED, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and PsycINFO, and checked the reference lists. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were included which evaluated psychosocial interventions in adult cancer patients during treatment, with fatigue as an outcome measure. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Three review authors independently extracted data from the selected studies, and assessed the methodological quality using several quality rating scales and additional criteria. MAIN RESULTS: Twenty-seven studies met the inclusion criteria with a total of 3324 participants, and seven studies reported significant effects of the psychosocial intervention on fatigue. In three studies the effect was maintained at follow-up. The quality of the studies was generally moderate. Effect sizes varied between 0.17 to 1.07.The effectiveness of interventions specific for fatigue was significantly higher (80%) compared to interventions not specific for fatigue (14%). In five studies the interventions were specifically focused on fatigue, with four being effective. The five interventions were brief, consisting of three individual sessions, provided by (oncology) nurses. In general, during these interventions participants were educated about fatigue, were taught in self-care or coping techniques, and learned activity management.Of the remaining 22 studies only three were effective in reducing fatigue, and these interventions had a more general approach. These interventions were aimed at psychological distress, mood and physical symptoms, and varied strongly in duration and content. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is limited evidence that psychosocial interventions during cancer treatment are effective in reducing fatigue. At present, psychosocial interventions specifically for fatigue are a promising type of intervention. However, there is no solid evidence for the effectiveness of interventions not specific for fatigue. Most aspects of the included studies were heterogeneous, and therefore it could not be established which other types of interventions, or elements were essential in reducing fatigue. THE EFFECT OF PSYCHOSOCIAL INTERVENTIONS ON FATIGUE DURING CANCER TREATMENT IN ADULTS: There is limited evidence that psychosocial interventions are effective in reducing fatigue during active treatment in cancer patients. Most promising are psychosocial interventions specifically designed to treat fatigue. In general, during these interventions patients were educated about fatigue, were taught in self-care or coping techniques, and learned to manage their activity. Interventions that did not focus on fatigue were rarely effective in reducing fatigue","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Countries in East Asia have lower rates of prostate cancer compared with Western countries such as Canada and the US. Some suggest that dietary differences between the two geographic regions, particularly the higher amount of phytoestrogens consumed in East Asia, is responsible for the difference in prostate cancer incidence. The mechanism of action of the soy isoflavones is incompletely understood, but in regards to prostate carcinogenesis likely involves estrogenic effects, cell cycle inhibition, anti-angiogenesis and induction of apoptosis. Recent clinical studies have provided mixed results with regard to a clear association between prostate cancer and soy consumption. Further studies are needed to understand more clearly the relationship between soy consumption and prostatic diseases","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Comparable efficacy with orchidectomy and, historically, diethylstilbestrol (DES) is accepted, with the advantages of reversibility and limited thromboembolic and cardiovascular toxicity, respectively. Side effects such as hot flushes, loss of libido, lethargy and decreased bone mineral density have recently stimulated more interest in the use of non-steroidal anti-androgens such as bicalutamide (Casodex, AstraZeneca) in locally advanced disease. Although better tolerated, bicalutamide has significant problems with gynaecomastia and breast pain. Maximal androgen blockade using LHRH analogues and their adjuvant use with radiotherapy are discussed, as well as their experimental application in intermittent androgen suppression therapy. Similar side effect profiles are reported for the LHRH analogues but injection tolerability differs with the smaller 23G needle for Prostap 3 compared to the 16G needle for Zoladex LA. There is no evidence to suggest a difference in the efficacy between the LHRH analogues goserelin and leuprorelin, although no direct comparison has yet been undertaken","","","","","","10.1517/14656566.3.12.1685 [doi]","Department of Urology, University Hospital Birmingham, Birmingham B15 2TH, UK. don@hartledon.freeserve.co.uk","PM:12472366","","","",""

The aim of the present study was to assess the feasibility and the oncologic outcome of radical prostatectomy administered to a consecutive unselected series of advanced, non-bone metastatic prostate cancers. METHODS: Between March 1998 and February 2003 radical prostatectomy was offered at our institution to any patient diagnosed with prostate cancer with no sign of extranodal metastatic disease. Data on morbidity and survival for 51 clinically advanced cases (any T>/=3, N0-N1, or any N1 or M1a disease according to the TNM 2002 classification system) operated on by a single expert surgeon were compared with a series of 152 radical prostatectomies performed during the same period by the same operator for clinically organ-confined disease. Adjuvant treatment was administered according to current guidelines. RESULTS: The two groups did not differ significantly in surgical morbidity except for blood transfusion, operative time, and lymphoceles, which showed a higher rate in patients with advanced disease. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of overall survival and prostate cancer-specific survival at 7 yr were 76.69% and 90.2% in the advanced disease group and 88.4% and 99.3% in the organ-confined disease group, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Even in the scenario of extensive surgical indications up to M1a disease, radical prostatectomy proved to be technically feasible and to have an acceptable morbidity rate compared with organ-confined disease. Our initial survival data strengthen the role for surgery as an essential part in the multimodal approach to treating advanced prostate cancer","","","","","","S0302-2838(06)01016-5 [pii];10.1016/j.eururo.2006.08.050 [doi]","Clinica Urologica I, Universita degli Studi di Torino, Torino, Italy. paolo.gontero@unito.it","PM:17049718","","","",""

Large numbers of gene-expression datasets on different aspects of prostate tumorigenesis are available. We used these data to identify and prioritize candidate genes associated with the development of prostate cancer and bone metastases. Our working hypothesis was that combining meta-analyses on different but overlapping steps of prostate tumorigenesis will improve identification of genes associated with prostate cancer development. METHODS: A Z score-based meta-analysis of gene-expression data was used to identify candidate genes associated with prostate cancer development. To put together different datasets, we conducted a meta-analysis on 3 levels that follow the natural history of prostate cancer development. For experimental verification of candidates, we used in silico validation as well as in-house gene-expression data. RESULTS: Genes with experimental evidence of an association with prostate cancer development were overrepresented among our top candidates. The meta-analysis also identified a considerable number of novel candidate genes with no published evidence of a role in prostate cancer development. Functional annotation identified cytoskeleton, cell adhesion, extracellular matrix, and cell motility as the top functions associated with prostate cancer development. We identified 10 genes--CDC2, CCNA2, IGF1, EGR1, SRF, CTGF, CCL2, CAV1, SMAD4, and AURKA--that form hubs of the interaction network and therefore are likely to be primary drivers of prostate cancer development. CONCLUSIONS: By using this large 3-level meta-analysis of the gene-expression data to identify candidate genes associated with prostate cancer development, we have generated a list of candidate genes that may be a useful resource for researchers studying the molecular mechanisms underlying prostate cancer development","","","","","","1471-2407-10-599 [pii];10.1186/1471-2407-10-599 [doi]","Department of Genitourinary Medical Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA. ipgorlov@mdanderson.org","PM:21044312","","","",""

Including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A and hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) expression, we studied relation to disease progression in prostate cancer. Different patient series were included. Sections from 104 radical prostatectomies with long follow-up, 33 castration-resistant prostate cancers, 28 nonskeletal metastases, 13 skeletal metastases, and 41 benign prostatic hyperplasias were immunostained for Nestin/Ki-67, VEGF-A, and HIF-1alpha. Vascular proliferation by Nestin/Ki-67-positive vessels was counted within 'hotspot' areas. Median vascular proliferation counts were 4- to 5-fold higher in castration-resistant prostate cancers and metastases versus localized cancers and prostatic hyperplasias (P < 0.0005). Among localized cancers, high vascular proliferation was significantly related to adverse clinicopathologic features and was a strong and independent predictor of biochemical failure (P < 0.005), clinical recurrence (P = 0.005), and skeletal metastasis (P = 0.025) in multivariate analysis. Castration-resistant cancers were characterized by reduced VEGF-A and increased HIF-1alpha expression, and vascular proliferation was associated with reduced patient survival in this group. Thus, vascular proliferation was of independent prognostic importance among prostate cancers. When compared with localized cancers, vascular proliferation was significantly increased in castration-resistant cases and metastatic lesions. The castration-resistant tumors exhibited weak VEGF-A but strong HIF-1alpha expression.

The therapeutic potential of zoledronic acid for the treatment of prostate cancer has been demonstrated in both preclinical and clinical studies. In patients receiving androgen-deprivation therapy, zoledronic acid increases bone mineral density, and, in patients with bone metastases, it reduces the incidence of skeletal complications. Preclinical studies have also demonstrated the antitumor potential of bisphosphonates. Specifically, zoledronic acid inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis of human prostate cancer cell lines in vitro and has enhanced antitumor activity when combined with taxanes. Animal models have further shown that bisphosphonates decrease tumor-induced osteolysis and reduce skeletal tumor burden. In a model of prostate cancer, zoledronic acid significantly inhibited growth of both osteolytic and osteoblastic tumors and reduced circulating levels of prostate-specific antigen. These studies suggest that zoledronic acid has the potential to inhibit bone metastasis and bone lesion progression in patients with prostate cancer.

OBJECTIVES: To establish whether administration of DHEA improves cognitive function or quality of life or reduces the rate of decline of cognitive function in normal older adults. SEARCH STRATEGY: The Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (CDCIG), The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL and LILACS were searched on 18 March 2008 using the terms: dhea*, prasterone, dehydroepiandrosterone*. The CDCIG Specialized Register contains records from all major health care databases (The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS) as well as from many clinical trials registries and grey literature sources.Relevant journals, personal communications and conference abstracts were searched for randomized controlled trials investigating the effects of DHEA/S on cognition in older adults. SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomized placebo-controlled trials enrolling people aged over 50 without dementia and to whom DHEA in any dosage was administered for more than one day were considered for inclusion in the review. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data for the specified outcomes were independently extracted by two reviewers (JGE and RM) and cross-checked. Any discrepancies were discussed and resolved. No data pooling was undertaken owing to the lack of availability of the relevant statistics. MAIN RESULTS: Five studies provided results from adequate parallel-group data. Barnhart 1999 and Dayal 2006 enrolled perimenopausal women with complaints of decreased well being and, using three cognitive measures, found no significant effect of DHEA compared with placebo at 3 months. Wolf 1998b enrolled 75 healthy volunteers (37 women and 38 men aged 59-81) in a study of the effect of DHEA supplements on cognitive impairment induced by stress; after two weeks of treatment, placebo group performance deteriorated significantly on a test of selective attention following a psychosocial stressor (p<0.05), while deterioration was not evident in the DHEA group (p=0.85). However, when compared with placebo, DHEA was associated with significant impairment on a visual memory recall test (p<0.01) following the stressor. No significant effects were found on a third cognitive task. Effects were not found on tasks when administered in the absence of a stressor. van Niekerk 2001 found no effect on cognitive function in 46 men aged 62-76 from three months of DHEA supplementation. Nair 2006, enrolled 57 women and 87 men with low level of sulphated DHEA in a 24-month study, no significant changes in quality of life measures for either sex were found. In Von Muhlen 2008 DHEA for one year showed no benefit on cognition performance in 225 healthy older people. Reduced performance in a visual memory recall test observed in one trial and a significant drop-out rate in favour of placebo emerged in another trial. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: What little evidence there is from controlled trials does not support a beneficial effect of DHEA supplementation on cognitive function of non-demented middle-aged or elderly people. There is inconsistent evidence from the controlled trials about adverse effects of DHEA.In view of growing public enthusiasm for DHEA supplementation, particularly in the USA, and the theoretical possibility of long-term neuroprotective effects of DHEA there is a need for further high quality trials in which the duration of DHEA treatment is longer than one year, and the number of participants is large enough to provide adequate statistical power. Cognitive outcomes should be assessed in all trials. NO CURRENT EVIDENCE FOR AN IMPROVEMENT IN MEMORY OR OTHER ASPECTS OF COGNITIVE FUNCTION OF NON-DEMENTED OLDER PEOPLE FOLLOWING DHEA SUPPLEMENTS: The adrenal hormone dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and its sulphated ester (DHEAS) are together the most abundant of steroid hormones in both sexes. Blood levels are high in young adults and decrease with advancing age. There is some epidemiological evidence that relatively high serum DHEAS levels in males may protect against heart disease and be associated with increased longevity. In the USA there is growing public enthusiasm for DHEA supplementation as a means of retarding ageing and age-associated cognitive impairment but there is very little evidence from controlled trials. In two trials DHEA was associated with a deleterious effect on visual memory after a psychosocial stressor and quality of life measures, but there is inconsistent systematic evidence of adverse effects from DHEA. Longer-term randomized placebo controlled trials are needed for low and high doses","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Bone metastases in patients with prostate cancer are associated with considerable morbidity, negatively impact quality of life, and can add substantially to medical costs, given a median survival of 30-35 months from diagnosis of bone metastases. Methods: A retrospective cost analysis from both a community and university hospital in The Netherlands was conducted. Twenty-eight patient records (14 from each hospital) were investigated to assess the impact of skeletal-related events (SREs), including fractures, spinal cord compression, and radiotherapy, on total direct medical costs and cost of hospitalization. Costs are given in EUROS ((euro)). Results: The average total cost of treatment was (euro)13,051 per patient over the 24-month follow-up period, which includes an average cost of (euro)6973 per patient to treat SREs. Treatment of SREs more than doubled total treatment costs. Patients in this analysis experienced, on average, one SRE per year, and the cost of SREs varied from (euro)1187 to (euro)40,948.

The time to begin docetaxel remains questionable. Regarding conventional therapy, the old cytotoxic agent estramustine is still controversial, but data suggest a survival advantage when combined with docetaxel. This therapeutic improvement has resulted in the clinical development of several new agents, some as monotherapy, others in combination with docetaxel, as first or second line treatment. Numerous clinical trials have improved the comprehension of the disease continuum, generating new recom mendations, especially concerning outcome measures. Two new drugs are being tested: the satraplatin and the ixabepilone. The principle of targeting bone metastasis has induced new options of treatment, such as targeting RANK-ligand, systemic radioisotopes, or the inhibition of the endothelin 1 receptor A. Antiangiogenic agents are also tested in clinical trials, especially bevacizumab, VEGF-trap and vandetanib. Furthermore, hormone manipulations appear promising, especially abiraterone acetate and the antagonists of the androgen receptor. (c) 2008 Springer Verlag","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Advanced PCa is initially sensitive to androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) but eventually progresses to castration resistance. Most treatments of PCa currently available are based on either cytotoxicity directed against tumour cells (chemotherapy) or targeting the androgen receptor directly or indirectly. Objective: Targeting agents have recently been developed to treat a variety of cancers. New and promising targets have been identified, and new agents targeting these molecules are currently being studied in patients with PCa. Some of these major potential targets are reviewed in this article. Recent data on a selection of new targets and new targeting agents are summarised in this review. The androgen receptor axis is active in the setting of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), and subsequent hormonemanipulation therapy showed anticancer activity using agents such as abiraterone or new-generation androgen receptor inhibitors. Another treatment strategy to consider is the use of targeted therapy to directly treat bone metastases. Several bone-targeting agents are currently in development, including ZD4054, which targets the endothelin type A receptor; denosumab, which targets the Rank-ligand axis; and the combination of docetaxel-based chemotherapy with samarium-153, a radiopharmaceutical agent. Moreover, a large number of other biological targets have been identified, and clinical trials are ongoing in a variety of PCa settings to test drugs targeting angiogenesis, proliferation, and apoptosis. A number of large randomized phase 3 trials are ongoing in patients with metastatic CRPC, and first results are awaited in 2009-2010. Conclusion: With the identification of new, promising biological tar gets and the availability of potentially active and well-tolerated targeting agents, most patients with CRPC should be offered participation in clinical trials and should be referred to centres in which these trials are available.

The combination of docetaxel with molecularly targeted therapies may offer the potential to increase the efficacy and decrease the toxicity of cytotoxic chemotherapy for prostate cancer. Previous studies demonstrate activation of the human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in prostate cancer. Erlotinib is a specific inhibitor of the tyrosine-kinase activity of EGFR. The goal of this study is to determine the anti-cancer activity docetaxel combined with erlotinib for the treatment of elderly subjects with AIPC. METHODS: This is a multi-institutional Phase II study in patients with histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate and age > or = 65 years. Patients were requred to have progressive disease despite androgen-deprivation therapy as determined by: (1) measurable lesions on cross-sectional imaging; (2) metastatic disease by radionucleotide bone imaging; or (3) elevated prostate specific antigen (PSA). Treatment cycles consisted of docetaxel 60 mg/m2 IV on day 1 and erlotinib 150 mg PO days 1-21. Patients with responding or stable disease after 9 cycles were eligible to continue on erlotinib alone as maintenance therapy. RESULTS: Characteristics of 22 patients enrolled included: median age 73.5 years (range, 65-80); median Karnofsky Performance Status 90 (range 70-100); median hemoglobin 12.1 g/dl (range, 10.0-14.3); median PSA 218.3 ng/ml (range, 9-5754). A median of 6 treatment cycles were delivered per patient (range 1-17). No objective responses were observed in 8 patients with measurable lesions (0%, 95% CI 0-31%). Bone scan improvement and PSA decline was seen in 1 patient (5%, 95% CI 0.1-25%). Five of 22 patients experienced > or = 50 % decline in PSA (23%, 95% CI 8-45%). Hematologic toxicity included grade 3 neutropenia in 9 patients and neutropenic fever in 2 patients. Common non-hematologic toxicities (> or = grade 3) included fatigue, anorexia, and diarrhea. CONCLUSION: Docetaxel/erlotinib can be delivered safely in elderly patients with AIPC. Anti-cancer disease activity appears generally comparable to docetaxel when used as monotherapy. Hematologic and non-hematologic toxicity may be increased over docetaxel monotherapy. Prospective randomized studies would be required to determine if the toxicity of docetaxel and erlotinib justifies its use in this setting","","","","","","1471-2407-7-142 [pii];10.1186/1471-2407-7-142 [doi]","Louis Warschaw Prostate Cancer Center, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA 90048, USA. mitchell.gross@cshs.org","PM:17662137","","","",""

Activation of the ET SUB A receptor by ET-1 has emerged as an important factor promoting tumor cell proliferation, survival, angiogenesis, migration, invasion, and metastasis in several tumor types including prostate, ovary, colon, cervix, breast, and lung. As activation of the ET SUB B receptor has an opposing effect, inducing cell death by apoptosis, a rationale exists for specific antagonism of the ET SUB A receptor as a treatment strategy for cancer. ZD4054 is a specific ET SUB A receptor antagonist currently being evaluated in hormone-resistant prostate cancer in phase III clinical trials. In vitro, ZD4054 reversed ET-1 -mediated inhibition of apoptosis in serum-deprived rat A10 and human VLTR-16 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. ZD4054 inhibited ET-1 -mediated survival signaling pathways and decreased proliferation in ovarian OVCA 433 and HEY cells and in prostate PPC-1 and LAPC-4 cells. In A673 rhabdomyosarcoma cells, ET-1-induced phosphorylation of FAK SUP tyr397 , FAK SUP tyr861 , and paxillin SUP tyr31 was reversed with ZD4054, inhibiting the invasive phenotype mediated by these adhesion factors. In vivo, ZD4054 led to a significant reduction in tumor growth in animals bearing ovarian tumor xenografts, and s ignificantly inhibited tumor angiogenesis. Pretreatment with ZD4054 also significantly delayed the onset of metastatic events after intracardiac injection of bladder TSU-Pr1 -B1 cells in mice. These preclinical data show the potential anticancer effects of the specific blockade of the ET SUB A receptor with ZD4054, supporting a program of clinical investigation.(c) 2009 Wolters Kluwer Health","","","","","","","","","","","",""

IDC-P was defined as malignant epithelial cells filling large acini and prostatic ducts, with preservation of basal cells forming either: (1) solid or dense cribriform patterns or; (2) loose cribriform or micropapillary patterns with either marked nuclear atypia (nuclear size 6 x normal or larger) or comedonecrosis. The numbers of cores involved by IDC-P in the biopsies ranged from 1 to 7, with >1 core involved in 17 cases. The architectural patterns of IDC-P were solid (12), dense cribriform (19), loose cribriform (17), and micropapillary (5). More than one pattern was present in 24 of 27 cases. The cytological features frequently observed in IDC-P were marked pleomorphism (18), non-focal comedonecrosis (22), and mitoses (20). Basal cells were observed on regular hematoxylin and eosin stained slides in 14 cases; in all the cases, basal cells were confirmed by immunohistochemical stains for high molecular weight cytokeratin (n=25) and/or p63 (n = 4). After the diagnosis of IDC-P on prostate biopsies, patients were treated by radical prostatectomy (6), radiation (7), hormone (5), combined radiation and hormone (1), or watchful waiting (2). The follow-up information was not available for six patients. The follow-up times ranged up to 4 years with an average of 2.1 years. In all six radical prostatectomy specimens, high-grade infiltrating carcinoma with Gleason score 8 or 9 was present with five cases also revealing prominent IDC-P. Non-focal extraprostatic extension of carcinoma was observed in five of the six prostatectomy cases with two cases also demonstrating vascular invasion. Three of 16 patients who did not receive radical prostatectomy developed bone metastases. Our study indicates that IDC-P on prostate biopsies is frequently associated with high-grade cancer and poor prognostic parameters at radical prostatectomy as well as potentially advanced disease following other therapies. These findings support prior studies that IDC-P represents an advanced stage of tumor progression with intraductal spread of tumor. Consideration should be given to treat patients with IDC-P on biopsy aggressively even in the absence of documented infiltrating cancer","","","","","","3800702 [pii];10.1038/modpathol.3800702 [doi]","Department of Pathology, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21231, USA","PM:16980940","","","",""

Material and Methods: A diagnostic cohort of 36 patients was included in skeletal scintigraphy and 1.5 T DWIBS MRI. Based on morphology and signal intensity p atterns, two readers each identified and classified independently, under blinded conditions, all lesions into three groups: (1) malignant, (2) unclear if malignant or benign and (3) benign. Finally, for the definition of the gold standard all available imaging techniques and follow-up over a minimum of 6 months were considered. Results: Overall, 45 circumscribed bone metastases and 107 benign lesions were found. DWIBS performed significantly better in detecting malignant skeletal lesions in patients with more than 10 lesions (sensitivity: 0.97/0.91) compared to skeletal scintigraphy (sensitivi ty: 0.48/0.42). No statistical difference could be found between DWIBS (0.58/0.33) and skeletal scintigraphy (0.67/0.58) in the sensitivity values for malignant skeletal lesions in patients with less than 5 lesions. For benign lesions, scintigraphy scored best with a sensitivity of 0.93/0.87 compared to 0.20/0.13 for DWIBS. Interobserver agreement with Cohen's kappa coefficient was calculated as 0.784 in the case of scintigraphy and 0.663 for DWIBS. Conclusion: With respect to staging, in prostate and breast carcinoma, the DWIBS technique is not superior to skeletal scintigraphy, but ranks equally. However, in the cases with many bone lesions, markedly more metastase s could be discovered using the DWIBS technique than skeletal scintigraphy. (c) 2009 ISS","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We investigated whether preoperative [18F]fluorocholine combined in-line positron emission tomography-computerized tomography and intraoperative laparoscopic radioisotope guided sentinel pelvic lymph node dissection can detect pelvic lymph node metastases in patients with clinically localized prostate cancer as reliably as extended pelvic lymph node dissection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 20 patients (mean age 63.9 +/- 6.7 years, range 52 to 75) with clinically localized prostate cancer, prostate specific antigen greater than 10 ng/ml, and/or a Gleason score sum of 7 or greater and negative bone scan were enrolled in the study. [18F]fluorocholine combined in-line positron emission tomography-computerized tomography was performed before surgery. Sentinel pelvic lymph node dissection preceded extended pelvic lymph node dissection including the area of the obturator fossa, external iliac artery/vein and internal iliac artery/vein up to the bifurcation of the common iliac artery. Laparoscopic radical prostatectomy was performed afterward. RESULTS: In 10 of the 20 patients (50%) lymph node metastases were detected, and were exclusively found outside the obturator fossa in 62%. These metastases would not have been identified with standard lymph node dissection of the obturator fossa only. [18F]fluorocholine combined in-line positron emission tomography-computerized tomography was true positive in 1, false-positive in 2, false-negative in 9 and true negative in 8 patients. The largest lymph node metastasis not seen with [18F]fluorocholine combined in-line positron emission tomography-computerized tomography was 8 mm. Laparoscopic sentinel guided lymph node dissection revealed lymph node metastases in 8 of 10 patients. In the other 2 patients sentinel lymph node dissection was not conclusive. In 1 patient normal nodal tissue was completely replaced by cancer and, therefore, there was no tracer uptake in the involved pelvic sidewall/node, and the other patient had no tracer activity at all in the involved pelvic sidewall. Extended pelvic lymph node dissection missed 1 lymph node metastasis (2 mm diameter near pudendal artery) which was detected by sentinel pelvic lymph node dissection only. CONCLUSIONS: Extended pelvic lymph node dissection reveals a higher number of lymph node metastases as described for obturator fossa dissection only. [18F]fluorocholine combined in-line positron emission tomography-computerized tomography is not useful in searching for occult lymph node metastases in clinically localized prostate cancer. Sentinel guided pelvic lymph node dissection allows the detection of even small lymph node metastases. The accuracy of sentinel pelvic lymph node dissection is comparable to that of extended pelvic lymph node dissection when the limitations of the method are taken into consideration","","","","","","S0022-5347(06)01699-5 [pii];10.1016/j.juro.2006.07.037 [doi]","Department of Urology, Elisabethinen Hospital, Linz, Austria","PM:17070241","","","",""

While localized disease has an excellent chance for cure, metastatic disease leads to androgen-independent progression and death within a few years. Although docetaxel represents an important therapeutic milestone and is the current standard of care for metastatic hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC), most patients eventually progress because of clonal selection of therapy-resistant cells or the development of cells with a drug-resistant phenotype. By understanding the molecular basis of resistance to androgen withdrawal and chemotherapy, the rational design of targeted therapeutics is possible. Over the last few years, many gene targets that regulate apoptosis, proliferation, and cell signalling have been identified, and numerous novel compounds have entered clinical trials either as single agents or in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy. Neoadjuvant trials in particular must be further encouraged since they allow detection of biological activity in the prostatectomy specimen. This article reviews new treatment options available for men with advanced prostate cancer. Even though HRPC remains incurable, it is not untreatable. Recent findings are very promising, but challenges remain in demonstrating effective anti-tumor activity and showing a clinically relevant survival benefit in Phase III trials","","","","","","S1078-1439(07)00142-1 [pii];10.1016/j.urolonc.2007.05.010 [doi]","The Prostate Centre at Vancouver General Hospital, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada","PM:17826663","","","",""

Although it is assumed that pain represents an adverse prognostic factor, this variable has not been extensively evaluated. The objective of this study was to determine whether men with CRPC who had higher pain interference scores at baseline had worse clinical outcomes compared with men who had lower pain scores. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data from three randomized phase III multicenter trials conducted by the Cancer and Leukemia Group B from 1992 to 1998 were combined. Eligible patients had progressive CRPC adenocarcinoma of the prostate, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 to 2, and adequate hematologic, renal, and hepatic functions. Seven items from the Brief Pain Inventory were used to assess the impact of pain on a range of daily activities and quality of life, each rated on a scale from 0 to 10. RESULTS: In 599 men, the median pain interference scores was 17 (interquartile range, 4 to 34), and 38% of the men had opioid analgesic use at baseline. There was a statistically significant association between pain interference scores and risk of death. The median survival times were 17.6 months (95% CI, 16.1 to 19.1 months) and 10.2 months (95% CI, 8.6 to 11.3 months; P < .001) in men with low (< 17) and high (>or= 17) pain scores, respectively. Pain was inversely associated with likelihood of prostate-specific antigen decline, objective response, and time to bone progression. CONCLUSION: This analysis demonstrates that pain is a statistically significant predictor of overall survival in men with metastatic CRPC. These results need to be validated prospectively in future phase III trials","","","","","","26/15/2544 [pii];10.1200/JCO.2007.15.0367 [doi]","Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, Duke University, and Cancer and Leukemia Group B Statistical Center, Durham, NC, USA. susan.halabi@duke.edu","PM:18487572","","","",""

Androgen ablation is the treatment of choice, but the majority of patients relapse within 2 to 3 years from initiation of treatment. After failure of hormone therapy, external-beam irradiation therapy is effective in the palliation of pain, but radionuclides represent an attractive and cost-effective alternative. Strontium 89 is currently the most commonly used radionuclide in the palliative management of prostate cancer metastatic to the skeleton. The rati onale for the use of bisphosphonates in metastatic prostate cancer is not immediately obvious, given the predominantly osteoblastic nature of the metastatic process. The clinical use of these agents rests on a number of basic and clinical observations that provide ample evidence that, in prostate cancer, the metastatic process is associated with increased bone resorption. Evidence regarding the beneficial effects of bisphosphonates in reducing morbidity from metastatic prostate cancer is reasonably solid, although the choice of optimal bisphosphonate, mode of administration, dose, and duration of treatment must be determined in large, controlled studies before their widespread clinical use can be advocated. Available therapeutic modalities that use either radionuclides or bisphosphonates can effectively and safely be used in the palliative management of metastatic prostate cancer. Neither radionuclides nor bisphosphonates have been shown to prolong survival, but the potential of both agents to beneficially alter the metastatic process in prostate cancer is intriguing.

METHODS: One hundred and seven patients with painful localized bone metastases requiring palliative radiotherapy were entered into a prospective randomized trial comparing 8 Gy single fraction (SF group) with 40 Gy in 20 fractions, five fractions/week (CF group). The primary tumor was in the breast in (48.1%) of the patients, in the lung in (20.6%) in the prostate in (17.6%), and in other sites in (13.7%). Bone metastases were located in the spine (42.2%), pelvis (29.4%) limbs (21.6%), and other sites (6.8%). Pain relief was measured by visual analogue scale (VAS) and also by analgesic requirement. Evaluation was performed before and at 2 weeks then every 4 weeks for 24 weeks after treatment. A total of 102 patients were evaluable for response; 50 in the SF group and 52 in the CF group. RESULTS: There were no significant diferences in the frequency or duration of pain relief between the two study groups. In both groups, the maximum benefit was achieved at 8 weeks after treatment; 41 patients (82%) in SF group and (44%) of those in the CF group. The frequency of pain by > or =50% on VAS. Complete pain relief was reported in (44%) of those in the CF group. The frequency of pain relief did not differ between the two groups with respect to the primary tumor, the metastatic sites, and the performance status, but for patients as a whole, there was a significantly lower response rate for lung cancer patients (61.9%) in comparision to patients with breast (91.8%) and prostate (100%) cancer. The median duration of pain relief was 12 weeks in the SF group and 13.5 weeks in CF group. During follow-up, 7 patients (6 in SF group and one in CF group) had their bone metastases re-irradiated. Six of these re-irradiated patients also achieved pain relief. CONCLUSION: This study indicates that a single fraction of 8 Gy is as effective as 40 Gy in 20 fractions for the palliation of painful bone metastases. Single fraction schedule may be preferred for patient convenience and an option for re-treatment in the case of recurrent pain","","","","","","","Department of Radiation-oncology, Faculty of Medicine, Zagazig University, Zagazig, Egypt. waleedham63@hotmail.com","PM:20084712","","","",""

A randomized, placebo-controlled study using (186)Re-etidronate was conducted on end-stage prostate cancer patients with metastatic bone pain. METHODS: Pain relief was assessed using an electronic diary containing questions reflecting the multidimensional character of chronic pain. The diary was marked twice daily for a maximum of 14 wk (2 wk before and 12 wk after the injection). Pain response was determined using a specific decision rule in which pain intensity, medication index, and daily activities were the core determinants. A positive response day was defined as a day on which pain intensity was reduced > or = 25% compared with baseline values, while medication index and daily activities were at least constant, or on which pain intensity was reduced < 25% and medication index or daily activities improved > or = 25%, without worsening of the remaining factor. The total response (%) was defined as the number of positive response days divided by the number of days of follow-up. RESULTS: Of the 111 included patients, 79 were evaluable (43 (186)Re-etidronate, 36 placebo). Thirty-two patients were excluded from the analysis because of incomplete datasets. The total response of the patients treated with (186)Re-etidronate varied from 0% to 96% (mean, 27%, or 23/84 d). In the placebo group, the total response varied from 0% to 80% (mean, 13%, or 11/84 d; Mann-Whitney U test, P < 0.05).

Methods: Pain relief was assessed using an electronic diary containing questions reflecting the multidimensional character of chronic pain. The diary was marked twice daily for a maximum of 14 wk (2 wk before and 12 wk after the injection). Pain response was determined using a specific decision rule in which pain intensity, medication index, and daily activities were the core determinants. A positive response day was defined as a day on which pain intensity was reduced >=25% compared with baseline values, while medication index and daily activities were at least constant, or on which pain intensity was reduced <25% and medication index or daily activities improved >=25%, without worsening of the remaining factor. The total response (%) was defined as the number of positive response days divided by the number of days of follow-up. Results: Of the 111 included patients, 79 were evaluable (43 <sup>186</sup>Re-etidronate, 36 placebo). Thirty-two patients were excluded from the analysis because of incomplete datasets. The total response of the patients treated with <sup>186</sup>Re-etidronate varied from 0% to 96% (mean, 27%, or 23/84 d). In the placebo group, the total response varied from 0% to 80% (mean, 13%, or 11/84 d; Mann-Whitney U test, P < 0.05). The number of patients who requested radiotherapy was higher in the placebo group (67%) than in the <sup>186</sup>Re-etidronate group (44%) (relative risk, 1.51; Fisher's exact test, P = 0.069). Conclusion: This randomized controlled trial confirmed that, compared with placebo, <sup>186</sup>Re-etidronate resulted in a significantly longer pain response in the treatment of bone pain from metastasized prostate cancer.

A total of 413 patients and 152 HCPs were interviewed across five centres worldwide. Mean scores were almost always higher for HCPs than for patients. Patients and HCPs agreed that four issues affect HRQOL of bone metastases patients profoundly: 'long-term (chronic) pain', 'difficulty in carrying out usual daily tasks', 'able to perform self-care' and 'able to perform role functioning'. A substantial difference was found with respect to the perceived importance of psychosocial and somatic issues. Patients emphasised psychosocial issues with a particular focus on 'worry' about loss of mobility, dependence on others and disease progression, HCPs however rated 'symptom' issues as more important, specifically those related to 'pain'. In conclusion, patients and HCPs agreed that pain and physical/role functioning are important to the HRQOL of cancer patients with bone metastases, but patients also emphasized the importance of psychosocial issues to HRQOL. This information has been an important component in the development of a health-related quality of life questionnaire for patients with bone metastases (EORTC QLQ-BM 22)","","","","","","S0959-8049(09)00381-5 [pii];10.1016/j.ejca.2009.05.024 [doi]","Department of Radiation Oncology, Odette Cancer Centre, University of Toronto, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, 2075 Bayview Avenue, Toronto, Ontario M4N 3M5, Canada","PM:19635661","","","",""

We investigated whether 8 Gy delivered in a single treatment fraction provides pain and narcotic relief that is equivalent to that of the standard treatment course of 30 Gy delivered in 10 treatment fractions over 2 weeks. METHODS: A prospective, phase III randomized study of palliative radiation therapy was conducted for patients with breast or prostate cancer who had one to three sites of painful bone metastases and moderate to severe pain. Patients were randomly assigned to 8 Gy in one treatment fraction (8-Gy arm) or to 30 Gy in 10 treatment fractions (30-Gy arm). Pain relief at 3 months after randomization was evaluated with the Brief Pain Inventory. The Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test was used to compare response to treatment in terms of pain and narcotic relief between the two arms and for each stratification variable. All statistical comparisons were two-sided. RESULTS: There were 455 patients in the 8-Gy arm and 443 in the 30-Gy arm; pretreatment characteristics were equally balanced between arms. Grade 2-4 acute toxicity was more frequent in the 30-Gy arm (17%) than in the 8-Gy arm (10%) (difference = 7%, 95% CI = 3% to 12%; P = .002). Late toxicity was rare (4%) in both arms. The overall response rate was 66%. Complete and partial response rates were 15% and 50%, respectively, in the 8-Gy arm compared with 18% and 48% in the 30-Gy arm (P = .6). At 3 months, 33% of all patients no longer required narcotic medications. The incidence of subsequent pathologic fracture was 5% for the 8-Gy arm and 4% for the 30-Gy arm. The retreatment rate was statistically significantly higher in the 8-Gy arm (18%) than in the 30-Gy arm (9%) (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Both regimens were equivalent in terms of pain and narcotic relief at 3 months and were well tolerated with few adverse effects. The 8-Gy arm had a higher rate of re-treatment but had less acute toxicity than the 30-Gy arm","","","","","","97/11/798 [pii];10.1093/jnci/dji139 [doi]","Advocate Good Samaritan Hospital, Downers Grove, IL, USA. william.hartsell-md@advocatehealth.com","PM:15928300","","","",""

METHODS: Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 9714 (RTOG 9714) was a randomized comparison of radiotherapy schedules for treatment of bone metastases. The treating physician assigned a baseline Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS) and predicted survival duration at study entry. Patients completed the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT). These three were compared to actual survival time. RESULTS: Eight hundred ninety-eight patients were eligible and analyzable. Actual median survival was 9.3 months. The median PSD was 12 months. PSD, KPS, and FACT were all moderately correlated with actual survival. Patients with higher KPS had a longer survival time (882 patients, Spearman's rho = 0.259, p < 0.0001). The median survival of the 618 expired patients is 6.5 months (PSD was 12 months). The PSD was within 1 month of actual survival in 61 (10%), with 177 (29%) patients surviving more than 1 month longer than predicted and 375 (61%) surviving more than 1 month less than predicted. A univariate analysis of actual overall survival was performed, dividing the PSD into 4 groups. For predicted survivals of 6 months or less, less than 6 to less than 12 months, 12 months, and more than 12 months, median actual survivals were 7.0, 7.2, 9.7. and 13.5 months (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: KPS, FACT scores, and PSD all are correlated with actual survival. Physicians on this study were able to predict which patients would have longer survival times, although prediction of survival was optimistic compared to actual survival by an average of 3 months","","","","","","10.1089/jpm.2007.0259 [doi]","Department of Radiation Oncology, Advocate Good Samaritan Cancer Center, Downers Grove, Illinois 60515, USA. william.hartsell-md@advocatehealth.com","PM:18588404","","","",""

METHODS: Fifty-seven patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer were treated with an oral administration of dexamethasone (1.0 mg/day), uracil plus tegafur (400 mg/day) and cyclophosphamide (100 mg/day). The median patient age was 71 years. Sixteen patients had symptomatic bone metastasis, 31 had asymptomatic bone metastasis and 8 showed lymph node metastasis. Eight patients presented with only biochemical progression as evaluated by serum prostate-specific antigen levels. RESULTS: Thirty-six (63%) of 57 patients demonstrated a >/=50% decline in serum prostate-specific antigen levels. The median time to prostate-specific antigen progression was 7.2 months. In patients with a prostate-specific antigen decline of >/=50%, the median time to progression was 13.3 months. With respect to pre-treatment markers, the duration of response to initial hormonal treatment was associated with the time to prostate-specific antigen progression. In 11 of 16 (69%) patients who complained of bone pain, the pain improved and became stable in 5 of those patients (31%). Most adverse events were mild and only three (5%) patients showed neutropenia of Grade 3 or higher. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of dexamethasone, uracil plus tegafur and cyclophosphamide is an effective and well tolerated regimen for hormone-refractory prostate cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with prostate cancer and first bone metastasis diagnosed from January 2003 to October 2006 were included. Patients were considered 'untreated' if no ZA was given, 'early ZA-treated' if ZA was initiated before skeletal complication (SC) occurrence or 'late ZA-treated' if one or more SC was documented before or at ZA initiation. Patients were classified with short (</= 90 days), medium (91-180 days) or long (>180 days) treatment persistence. Assessments included follow-up duration (FUP) and risk of developing one or more SC. RESULTS: Among eligible patients, 847 were untreated, 243 were early ZA-treated and 218 were late ZA-treated. For untreated versus early ZA-treated groups, median FUP was 263 versus 357 days (p < 0.0001), respectively, and time to first SC was 199 versus 273 days (p < 0.0001), respectively. ZA treatment was associated with significantly longer FUP and lower SC risk. The early ZA-treated group had significantly longer FUP versus the late ZA-treated group (median days, 357 vs. 299.5); the late ZA-treated group experienced significantly higher SC risk vs. the early ZA-treated group (odds ratio, 1.51). Compared with the long-persistence group, FUP was 56% and 40% shorter in the short and medium groups, respectively (p < 0.0001).

In one report, the control of central pain (thalamic pain syndrome) was also approached with chemical hypophysectomy. Although in most of the patients these treatments resulted in a decrease in severe pain, concomitantly severe adverse effects (panhypopituitarism, diabetes insipidus and visual dysfunction) occurred in most patients. This historical evidence prompted us to perform Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) for this kind of intractable severe pain using a high irradiation dose to the pituitary stalk/gland. In the majority of patients, marked pain relief was achieved, surprisingly without any of the complications mentioned above. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective multicenter study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety in patients treated in Prague, Hong Kong and Tokyo. Indications of this treatment were: (1) failure of other effective treatment approaches prior to GKS, (2) good general patient condition (Karnofsky performance status >40%), (3) response to morphine for pain control (cancer pain), and (4) no previous radiotherapy of brain metastases (GKS/conventional radiotherapy). Eight patients with severe cancer pain due to bone metastasis and 12 patients with post-stroke thalamic pain syndrome were treated with GKS. The target was the border between the pituitary stalk and gland. Maximum dose was 160 Gy for cancer pain and 140 Gy for central pain. Follow-up included 6 patients (>1 month) with cancer pain and 8 patients (> 6 months) with thalamic pain syndrome. RESULTS: All patients (6/6) with cancer pain experienced significant pain reduction, and 87.5% (7/8) of the patients with thalamic pain had initially significant pain reduction. In some patients, pain reduction was delayed for several hours. Pain relief was noted within 7 days (median 2 days). No recurrence was observed in the patients with cancer pain. However, in 71.4% (5/7) of the patients with thalamic pain syndrome, disease recurred during the 6-month follow-up. Up to now, other complications have not been observed. CONCLUSION: Our clinical study protocol is only preliminary. Further clinical results on the management of thalamic pain are required to develop this treatment protocol. However, efficacy and safety have been shown in all our cases. In our opinion, this treatment has a potential to control severe pain, and GKS will play an important role in the management of intractable pain","","","","","","10.1159/000075108 [doi];75108 [pii]","Department of Neurosurgery, Neurological Institute, Tokyo Women's Medical University, Tokyo, Japan.

Their clinical outcome has not been studied. We studied thirteen such cases with long-term clinical follow-up. Patients were followed between 9 and 94 months after surgery. Of 13 cases, 9 were chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL), 3 marginal zone B-cell lymphoma (MZL) and 1 mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). All 13 patients did not receive radiation or chemotherapy; and five of 13 cases showed hematologic evidence of lymphoma progression between 1 and 5 months after radical prostatectomy. After progression, the mantle cell lymphoma patient received aggressive chemotherapy and had systemic dissemination. Two of 13 cases had recurrent prostate carcinoma. None of 13 patients had died from lymphoma or prostate carcinoma at the last follow-up. In conclusion, most incidental pelvic node lymphomas (8/13) showed no evidence of systemic dissemination to peripheral blood or bone marrow after a mean 42.8 weeks of follow-up despite the fact that no additional treatment was given. Strong consideration should be given to withholding further treatment in patients diagnosed with pelvic low-grade B-cell lymphoma at the time of radical prostatectomy until disease progression occurs","","","","","","782741634 [pii];10.1080/10428190701584007 [doi]","Division of Pathology, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California 91010, USA","PM:17917966","","","",""

To compare the effect on overall survival of total androgen ablation (TAA) with that of parenteral estrogen and to pay special attention to cardiovascular mortality. TAA (orchiectomy or a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogue combined with an antiandrogen) has been proposed as superior to other endocrine treatments for patients with prostate carcinoma. Recently, the use of parenteral estrogen has been suggested to reduce or even negate the well-known cardiovascular side effects of oral estrogens. Methods. Nine hundred fifteen patients were randomized to intramuscular injections of 240 mg polyestradiol phosphate (PEP) every second week for the first 8 weeks (5 doses) followed by a maintenance dose of 240 mg every month (n = 458) or to bilateral orchiectomy or triptorelin 3.75 mg every month combined with the antiandrogen flutamide 250 mg three times daily. The choice between orchiectomy and triptorelin was at the discretion of the clinician and patient. Patients were stratified according to performance status, presence of cardiovascular disease, and alkaline phosphatase level. An observer totally unaware of the treatment given classified all deceased patients. Results. At a median follow-up of 18.5 months, no signs of a difference in overall survival were found between TAA and PEP (P <0.001). Of 458 patients, 266 (58.1%) had died in the PEP group compared with 269 (58.9%) of 457 patients in the TAA group. Within the TAA group, no difference in overall survival existed between patients who had undergone orchiectomy or who were given triptorelin. Furthermore, no differences in cardiovascular mortality were found (3.5% in the PEP group and 3.1% in the TAA group).Conclusions. The current parenteral estrogen regimen seems to be of comparable efficacy and cardiovascular safety as TAA in terms of overall survival. PEP has by far the lowest drug cost and also the lowest cumulative direct costs and thus has the highest cost-effectiveness. We suggest that parenteral estrogen be included as a therapeutic option in the endocrine management of prostate carcinoma. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc. Number of References 16.

The aim of the study was to compare anticancer efficacy and adverse events, especially cardiovascular events. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In total, 910 eligible patients with T0-4, NX, M1, G1-3 prostate cancer with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2 were randomized to treatment with either PEP 240 mg i.m. twice a month for 2 months and thereafter monthly, or flutamide (Eulexin) 250 mg t.i.d. per os in combination with either triptorelin (Decapeptyl) 3.75 mg i.m. per month or on an optional basis bilateral orchidectomy. RESULTS: At this final evaluation of the trial 855 of the 910 patients were dead. There was no difference between the treatment groups in terms of biochemical or clinical progression-free survival or in overall or disease-specific survival. There was no difference in cardiovascular mortality, but a significant increase in non-fatal cardiovascular events in the PEP arm (p<0.05) predominantly caused by an increase in ischemic heart and heart decompensation events. There were 18 grave skeletal events in the CAD group but none in the PEP group (p=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: PEP has an anticancer efficacy equal to CAD and does not increase cardiovascular mortality in metastasized patients, but carries a significant risk of non-fatal cardiovascular events, which should be balanced against the skeletal complications in the CAD group. It is feasible to use Estradurin in the primary or secondary endocrine treatment of metastasized patients without prominent cardiac risk factors and especially those with osteoporosis","","","","","","790735785 [pii];10.1080/00365590801943274 [doi]","Department of Urology, Karolinska University Hospital Solna, Sweden. krea@beta.telenordia.se","PM:18432528","","","",""

Two such options are radical prostatectomy (RP) and watchful waiting (WW). WW involves providing no initial treatment and monitoring the patient with the intention of providing palliative treatment if there is evidence of disease progression. OBJECTIVES: To compare the beneficial and harmful effects of RP versus WW for the treatment of localised prostate cancer. SEARCH STRATEGY: MEDLINE, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library, ISI Science Citation Index, DARE and LILACS were searched through 30 July 2010. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing the effects of RP versus WW for clinically localised prostate cancer. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data extraction and quality assessment were carried out independently by two authors. MAIN RESULTS: Two trials met the inclusion criteria. Both trials commenced prior to the widespread availability of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening; hence the results may not be applicable to men with PSA-detected disease.One trial (N = 142), conducted in the US, was judged to be of poor quality. All cause (overall) mortality was not significantly different between RP and WW groups after fifteen years of follow up (Hazard Ratio (HR) 0.9 (95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.56 to 1.43).The second trial (N = 695), conducted in Scandinavia, was judged to be of good quality. After 12 years of follow up, the trial results were compatible with a beneficial effect of RP on the risks of overall mortality, prostate cancer mortality and distant metastases compared with WW but the precise magnitude of the effect is uncertain as indicated by the width of the confidence intervals for all estimates (risk difference (RD) -7.1% (95% CI -14.7 to 0.5); RD -5.4% (95% CI -11.1 to 0.2); RD -6.7% (95% CI -13.2 to -0.2), respectively). Compared to WW, RP increased the absolute risks of erectile dysfunction (RD 35% (95% CI 25 to 45)) and urinary leakage (RD 27% (95% CI 17 to 37)). These estimates must be interpreted cautiously as they are derived from data obtained from a self-administered questionnaire survey of a sample of the trial participants (N = 326), no baseline quality of life data were obtained and nerve-sparing surgery was not routinely performed on trial participants undergoing RP. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The existing trials provide insufficient evidence to allow confident statements to be made about the relative beneficial and harmful effects of RP and WW for patients with localised prostate cancer. The results of ongoing trials should help to inform treatment decisions for men with screen-detected localised prostate cancer. RADICAL PROSTATECTOMY (RP) VERSUS WATCHFUL WAITING (WW) FOR THE TREATMENT OF LOCALIZED PROSTATE CANCER: A REVIEW OF THE EVIDENCE: In this review the best available evidence comparing the effects of two treatment options for localised prostate cancer, namely radical prostatectomy (RP) which involves surgically removing the prostate gland versus a 'watchful waiting' (WW) approach was examined. In this review, WW is defined as any conservative approach to the management of prostate cancer whereby a decision is made to provide no initial treatment and to monitor the patient. If the monitoring procedure provides evidence of disease progression, then palliative treatment is offered to the patient, which is intended to alleviate disease symptoms without attempting to cure the disease.Two completed randomised controlled trials were identified. One trial was considered to be of good quality whilst the second trial was of poor quality. The two trials commenced prior to the widespread use of the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test as a screening test for prostate cancer, and hence did not involve many men with PSA-detected cancers. Ongoing trials (PIVOT; ProtecT; START) will provide evidence of the comparative effects of RP and observation protocols for men with PSA-detected cancers.The one good quality trial included in this review involved men with cancers detected by methods other than screening who were randomly allocated to either RP or WW and followed up for 12 years. This single trial does not provide sufficient evidence to allow confident statements to be made about the magnitude of any beneficial and harmful effects of RP compared with WW for men with clinically detected prostate cancers. The trial results indicate that RP is likely to reduce the risks of overall mortality, prostate-cancer mortality and distant metastases (cancer spread) compared to WW, but the magnitude of the effect is unclear. Furthermore, the risk reductions appear to have been limited to men less than 65 years of age. This trial also provides evidence that RP increases the risks of erectile dysfunction and urinary leakage. However, because of the manner in which the data on adverse effects were collected in the trial, confident statements cannot be made about how frequently these adverse effects occur. In addition, nerve-sparing surgery, which has the potential to reduce these complications, was not routinely performed on participants in the trial.A shared approach to decision-making is required whereby patients and their healthcare providers openly discuss the patient's personal values, preferences, and the limitations of the available evidence on potential benefits and potential harms of these treatment options","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Herein, the future role of zoledronic acid in the treatment of prostate cancer and novel agents with potential clinical benefit for the treatment of bone metastases will be discussed. Published studies were identified through MEDLINE searches, review of bibliographies of relevant articles, and review of abstracts from scientific meetings. Data from preclinical studies have demonstrated that zoledronic acid has antitumor potential. Zoledronic acid inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in several prostate cancer cell lines and inhibits bone metastases in animal models of prostate cancer. Therefore, clinical trials are under way to assess the efficacy of zoledronic acid in the prevention of bone metastases in patients with prostate cancer or renal cell carcinoma. Currently, new strategies for the treatment and prevention of bone metastases are being investigated. Combinations of zoledronic acid plus other agents, including taxanes and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors, have demonstrated additive or synergistic antitumor activity. Other agents are under development that may improve clinical outcomes in patients with bone metastases. These agents include inhibitors of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption, such as cathepsin K inhibitors and osteoprotegerin analogues, and inhibitors of osteoblast activity. The role of zoledronic acid in the treatment and prevention of bone metastases in men with prostate cancer continues to evolve, and new agents are being investigated. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

We assessed the clinical efficacy of bisphosphonate in the management of symptomatic skeletal metastases due to prostate cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 85 patients with painful osseous metastases due to hormone refractory prostate cancer were treated with clodronate in an open prospective nonrandomized clinical study. Clodronate was started as an intravenous phase for 8 days at a dose of 300 mg. daily followed by an oral maintenance phase of 1,600 mg. daily. The primary study end point was decreased pain without an increase in analgesic medication for at least 2 consecutive measurements. Secondary end points were decreased analgesics, an improved Karnofsky index and mobility as well as the duration of bisphosphonate action. Decreased pain was documented by a 10-point visual analog scale and consumption of analgesics was documented in a diary. RESULTS: A palliative response with a significant decrease in mean pain score from 7.9 (range 6 to 10) to 2.5 (range 0 to 4) (p <0.001) was achieved in 64 of the 85 patients (75%), 19 (22%) were completely pain-free without further need of analgesics and 45 significantly decreased the daily consumption of analgesics. The mean duration of bisphosphonate action was 9 weeks (range 4 to 22) and mean survival was 12 weeks (range 6 to 22). Improvement in bone pain was paralleled by an improvement in the mean Karnofsky index of 45% (range 30% to 60%) to 70% (range 50% to 80%) at the end of the treatment period. CONCLUSIONS: Bisphosphonate treatment of painful osseous metastases due to hormone refractory prostate cancer results in a significant pain decrease and a significant decrease in the daily consumption of analgesics in 75% of patients. Each characteristic is paralleled by an increase in the Karnofsky index, mainly due to better mobility.

Currently available data support their routine use to prevent androgen-deprivation-induced osteoporosis and its secondary complications. Dosing at 3-month intervals is appropriate; further studies will have to demonstrate the efficacy of annual dosing. In men with already established bone metastases, BPs might be helpful in preventing skeletal-related events in patients who do not respond to alternative therapies and are at high risk for bone fractures or spinal cord compression. In patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer, BPs might be administered for analgesic purposes.

On the basis of doxorubicin's demonstrated clinical efficacy against hormone-refractory prostate carcinoma (HRPCA), the authors conducted a prospective, randomized Phase II clinical trial to evaluate the feasibility, toxicity, and therapeutic efficacy associated with the pegylated form of this agent. METHODS: Forty-eight patients with symptomatic HRPCA were randomized to receive pegylated liposomal doxorubicin at either 25 mg/m2 every 2 weeks for 12 cycles (Group A) or 50 mg/m2 every 4 weeks for 6 cycles (Group B). Thirty-eight of these 48 patients (79%) presented with severe pain (corresponding to a pain score of 7.5 on a visual analog scale [VAS] ranging from 0 to 10) due to osseous metastases. Therapeutic efficacy was assessed by serial evaluation of serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) concentrations and by serial measurement of pain levels (using a VAS ranging from 0 to 10). Toxicity data were obtained using the National Cancer Institute of Canada/Cancer and Leukemia Group B criteria and the 30-item European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire. RESULTS: The median patient age was 68.9 years (range, 58-79 years), and the mean follow-up duration was 42 months. The mean pretreatment PSA level was 660.4 ng/mL (mean, 8-6340 ng/mL); an objective decrease in PSA levels (i.e., a decrease of > 50%) was observed in 8 of 31 patients (25.8%) in Group B, whereas no other patient in either group experienced such a decrease. The mean time to disease progression was 6.5 months, and the mean survival duration was 13.4 months. Patients in Group B had a significantly higher rate of response with respect to pain (52.6% vs. 28.6%; P = 0.04), and the mean 1-year survival rate also was significantly higher in Group B (42% vs. 15%; P = 0.02). Severe side effects were observed, with 24 patients (50%) experiencing World Health Organization Grade 3/4 toxicity. Toxicity types differed significantly between Group A and Group B; palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia developed in 60% of patients in the former group (P < 0.0005), whereas tachycardia was more common in the latter group (39% of patients; P < 0.0005). No dose-limiting cardiotoxicities or hematotoxicities were documented. CONCLUSIONS: Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin yielded a noteworthy objective palliative response rate and a mean survival of 13 months for patients with symptomatic HRPCA. The dosage tested in the current study should be used in future Phase II and Phase III trials of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin-containing combination regimens for patients with HRPCA","","","","","","10.1002/cncr.20455 [doi]","Department of Urology, University of Cologne, Germany. axel.heidenreich@uk-koeln.de","PM:15329902","","","",""

However, about 90% of the men treated will develop PSA progression within 3-4 years resulting in androgen-independent and later on hormone-refractory prostate cancer. Management of AIPCA and HRPCA still represents a therapeutic challenge despite the development of new and effective treatment options. PSA progression following primary ADT defines an androgen-refractory but still hormone-sensitive PCA which might respond to secondary hormonal manipulations such as antiandrogen withdrawal, addition of nonsteroidal antiandrogens, and administration of estrogens, ketoconazole and hydrocortisone, and somatostatin analogues.

Sometimes local progression of PCA with subvesical obstruction following radiation therapy requires radical cystoprostatectomy or bladder-preserving urinary diversion. We present our experience with salvage radical prostatectomy in a group of 28 consecutive patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 2003 and August 2005, 25 patients underwent radical salvage surgery for locally recurrent PCA following external beam radiation (n=14), high-dose brachytherapy (n=8), and low-dose brachytherapy (n=6). All men had biopsy-proved recurrent or persistent PCA associated with PSA progression following radiation therapy. Preoperative imaging studies included bone scintigraphy and computed tomography without evidence of metastatic disease. Of the 28 men, 11 (39%) presented with bothersome irritative voiding dysfunction and rectal discomfort. Life expectancy was >10 years in all cases. We analyzed preoperative symptoms, treatment-associated morbidity, pathohistological findings, and functional and oncological outcome after a mean follow-up of 12.5 (2-29) months. RESULTS: SRP was performed in all cases without significant intra- and perioperative complications: no rectal lacerations or ureteral lesions were encountered and mean blood loss was 520 (200-950) ml. A total of 21 (75%) men underwent SRP: in 4 cases radical cystoprostatectomy was necessary due to bladder neck infiltration and in 3 men SRP with bladder neck closure and continent appendicovesicostomy was performed due to preexisting urinary stress incontinence. All men with subvesical obstruction experienced significant relief of urgency and significant irritative voiding dysfunction following radical salvage surgery. Pathohistological analysis of the prostatectomy specimen revealed pT1-2b PCA in 19 (67.8%), pT3a/b PCA in 5 (17.8%), and lymph node metastasis or positive surgical margins in 7% of the patients. Two patients demonstrated a pT0 despite positive preoperative biopsies, and 20% demonstrated a Gleason score 8-10. With regard to functional outcome, 25% of the men need 2-3 pads daily whereas 78% of the men are continent. After a mean follow-up of 12.5 (2-29) months, two patients with pT3b and pN1 status exhibit a PSA relapse. CONCLUSION: Salvage RP or RCx is a technically challenging but feasible surgical approach with curative intent for the treatment of locally recurrent PCA in well selected patients preventing significant local complications such as subvesical obstruction, ureteral obstruction, hematuria, and rectal infiltration. Surgery-associated morbidity and complications are low and not comparable to earlier series. The indication for salvage RP requires positive biopsy and negative imaging studies","","","","","","10.1007/s00120-006-0995-9 [doi]","Sektion fur Urologische Onkologie, Klinik und Poliklinik fur Urologie, Universitat Koln. axel.heidenreich@uk-koeln.de","PM:16465521","","","",""

Although ADT has been successfully used for more than 60 years, there are still major controversies with regard to the initiation (early versus delayed), type (complete versus monotherapy), and duration (continuous versus intermittent) of treatment. It is the purpose of this review to critically present the results of the various ADT options. Bilateral orchiectomy and subcutaneous application of luteinising hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) analogues represent the guideline-recommended standard treatment for metastatic PCA, whereas estrogens are no longer recommended because of significant cardiovascular side effects despite comparable therapeutic efficacy. Antiandrogen monotherapy with bicalutamide is comparable to LHRH analogues in men with minimal tumour burden. However, survival rates are inferior in patients with extensive metastatic disease, in whom medical or surgical castration should be favoured. Complete ADT results in a median survival benefit of about 5% in men with low metastatic tumour burden, and it cannot be recommended for routine use. Early ADT is associated with a significant advantage in terms of symptom-free survival and prevention of metastasis-associated complications, but it does not result in a prolonged progression-free and overall survival when compared with delayed ADT. Despite encouraging results, intermittent ADT remains an experimental therapeutic approach that should be considered on an individual basis in carefully selected patients. Adjuvant ADT is still discussed controversially for men after radical prostatectomy, whereas it has become the standard approach in patients who undergo external beam radiation for locally advanced PCA","","","","","","10.1007/s00120-008-1636-2 [doi]","Bereich Urologische Onkologie,Klinik und Poliklinik fur Urologie, Universitat zu Koln, Koln, Germany. axel.heidenreich@uk-koeln.de","PM:18273599","","","",""

The currently available guidelines on diagnosis and treatment of urogenital cancer do not provide the clinician with evidence-based recommendations for daily practice. OBJECTIVES: To develop scientifically valid recommendations with regard to the most appropriate imaging technique and the most useful time interval in metastatic urogenital cancer patients undergoing systemic therapy. METHODS: A systematic literature review was performed searching MedLine, Embase and Web of Science databases using the terms prostate, renal cell, bladder and testis cancer in combination with the variables lymph node, lung, liver, bone metastases, chemotherapy and molecular therapy, and the search terms computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography were applied. A total of 11,834 records were retrieved from all databases. The panel reviewed the records to identify articles with the highest level of evidence using the recommendation of the US Agency for Health Care Policy and Research. CONCLUSIONS: Contrast-enhanced computed tomography remains the standard imaging technique for monitoring of pulmonary, hepatic and lymph node metastases. Bone scintigraphy is still the most widely used imaging technique for the detection and follow-up of osseous lesions. For clinical trials it might be replaced by either PET-CT or MRI of the skeletal axis. Response assessment for patients treated with cytotoxic regime is best performed by the RECIST/WHO criteria; treatment response to molecular triggered therapy is best assessed by CT evaluating decrease in tumor size and density. Cross-sectional imaging studies for response assessment might be obtained after each 2 cycles of systemic therapy to early stratify responders from non-responders","","","","","","000318985 [pii];10.1159/000318985 [doi]","Department of Urology, RWTH University, Aachen, Germany. aheidenreich @ ukaachen.de","PM:20693823","","","",""

Hence, the purpose of our study has been to determine whether this is true also for PET/CT using F-18-fluorocholine (FCH PET/CT) or whether it is possible to obtain true positive results by FCH PET/CT even at lower PSA levels. Methods: In 34 patients with prostate cancer who had undergone initial therapy (radical prostatectomy n = 31, radiotherapy n = 3), a PET/CT scan was performed using F-18-fluorocholine (FCH) during follow-up in case of demonstrable or rising PSA levels. Current PSA levels were determined in all patients at the time of examination. Results: Median PSA in FCH positive patients was 6.1 ng/ml (mean PSA 17.1 ng/ml), median PSA in FCH negative patients was 2.3 ng/ml (mean PSA 3.4 ng/ml), respectively (p < 0.05). In eight of 17 examinations (47%) with PSA < 5 ng/ml, at least one FCH-positive focus was detected. So far the findings could be confirmed by correlating imaging methods (CT and/or MR), biopsy/histology and the course of the disease, respectively, in seven of the eight FCH-positive cases with PSA < 5 ng/ml, so that a true positive FCH PET/CT finding was obtained all in all in seven of 17 (41%) examinations with PSA < 5 ng/ml. In four of these seven FCH PET-positive patients with PSA < 5 ng/ml, adjuvant hormonal therapy was administered at the time of the examination or prior to the examination. Conclusion: In re-staging patients with prostate cancer, FCH PET/CT is able to yield true positive findings even at PSA < 5 ng/ml. Therefore, FCH PET/CT should not be restricted to patients with PSA > 5 ng/ml. (c) Academy of Molecular Imaging 2005","","","","","","","","","","","",""

RESULTS: Denosumab was noninferior to ZA in delaying time to first on-study SRE (hazard ratio, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.71 to 0.98; P = .0007). Although directionally favorable, denosumab was not statistically superior to ZA in delaying time to first on-study SRE (P = .03 unadjusted; P = .06 adjusted for multiplicity) or time to first-and-subsequent (multiple) SRE (rate ratio, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.77 to 1.04; P = .14). Overall survival and disease progression were similar between groups. Hypocalcemia occurred more frequently with denosumab. Osteonecrosis of the jaw occurred at similarly low rates in both groups. Acute-phase reactions after the first dose occurred more frequently with ZA, as did renal adverse events and elevations in serum creatinine based on National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events grading. CONCLUSION: Denosumab was noninferior (trending to superiority) to ZA in preventing or delaying first on-study SRE in patients with advanced cancer metastatic to bone or myeloma. Denosumab represents a potential novel treatment option with the convenience of subcutaneous administration and no requirement for renal monitoring or dose adjustment","","","","","","JCO.2010.31.3304 [pii];10.1200/JCO.2010.31.3304 [doi]","Joan Karnell Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA 19106, USA. davidhenry@pennoncology.com","PM:21343556","","","",""

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Men with advanced prostate cancer were randomly assigned to receive triptorelin 3.75 mg or leuprolide 7.5 mg. The agent was injected intramuscularly every 28 days for nine injections. Primary endpoints were the percentages of men whose serum testosterone concentrations declined to and were maintained at or below castrate levels (</= 1.735 nmol/L or </= 500 ng/L) during 9 months (253 days) of treatment. Secondary endpoints were luteinizing hormone levels, bone pain, prostate specific antigen levels, quality of life, testosterone pharmacodynamics, survival, and safety variables. RESULTS: In all, 284 men received either triptorelin (140) or leuprolide (144). The percentage of men with castrate levels of serum testosterone was lower at 29 days for triptorelin than for leuprolide (91.2% vs 99.3%; point estimate - 8.0, 95% confidence interval - 16.9% to - 1.4%), but equivalent at 57 days (97.7% vs 97.1%). The mean (98.8% vs 97.3%) and cumulative (96.2% vs 91.2%) castration maintenance rates between 29 and 253 days were equivalent between the treatment groups. Secondary endpoints were equivalent between treatment groups except for the 9-month survival rate, which was significantly higher for triptorelin than for leuprolide (97.0% vs 90.5%; P = 0.033). Both treatments were well tolerated. CONCLUSION: Triptorelin reduced testosterone concentrations less rapidly, but maintained castration as effectively as leuprolide. There was no evidence that the slower onset of castration caused deleterious effects","","","","","","4308 [pii]","Department of Urology, University of Stellenbosch, Tygerberg Hospital, Western Cape, South Africa. cfh2@sun.ac.za","PM:12887472","","","",""

A total of 19 hormone-naive patients with Stage D0 disease were treated with a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analog and an antiandrogen for 9 months, after which AS was discontinued. When the prostate-specific antigen level reached a predetermined threshold, AS was restarted. BMD was measured at baseline, after 9 months of AS, and at the end of the first off-treatment period or at 1 year, whichever occurred first. Of the 19 patients, 17 had normal BMD at baseline; 2 patients with osteopenia at baseline were excluded from the analysis. All but 1 of the 17 patients with normal baseline BMD experienced a decline in BMD in the lumbar spine or hip, or both, during AS. After 9 months, the mean BMD in these patients had decreased by 4.5% at the lumbar spine (P = 0.0007) and by 2.5% at the hip (P = 0.00013). After a median off-treatment period of 7.9 months, the mean change in BMD of the lumbar spine and hip relative to the post-AS values was 1.5% (P = 0.06) and -0.01% (P = 0.09), respectively. The observed loss of BMD during 9 months of AS is significantly greater than the expected 0.5% to 1% annual loss. Interruption of AS attenuated the rate of bone loss, although full recovery to the baseline BMD was not achieved in all patients. These data suggest that men treated with AS should undergo baseline and periodic follow-up BMD assessments, because significant bone loss can occur during the first 9 months of AS.

In the general population, however, the incidence of low BMD is increasing in elderly men. Men suffer more morbidity and mortality from fractures associated with low BMD than women. Problems of underdiagnosis and undertreatment in men can be addressed with enhanced awareness of the risk factors for bone loss in men and the available treatment options. Guidelines for diagnosis of low BMD in women can probably be applied to men. Treatment options have not been studied as extensively in men. For men treated with ADT for prostate cancer, however, use of intravenous zoledronic acid at the initiation of ADT has been shown to prevent and even reverse bone loss. Although the routine use of bisphosphonates to prevent bone loss is not yet recommended, zoledronic acid is a logical choice of therapy in men who have low BMD at baseline or who develop bone loss during the course of therapy. In addition to its effects on BMD, zoledronic acid has also been shown to decrease skeletal morbidity in men with metastatic hormone-refractory prostate cancer. Whether zoledronic acid or other bisphosphonates might actually prevent or delay the development of bone metastases remains to be studied in randomized clinical trials","","","","","","S1078143903001431 [pii]","Departments of Medicine and Urology, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA 98109, USA. thigano@u.washington.edu","PM:14670551","","","",""

Clinicians prescribing ADT should appreciate the potential effects of ADT on BMD as well as the morbidity and mortality that can result from osteoporotic fractures. Measures to address the evaluation of patients and when to treat patients with significant bone loss have been discussed. Bisphosphonates effectively prevent loss of BMD in prostate cancer patients. Treatment of prostate cancer patients with established bone metastases with zoledronic acid should be considered strongly based on the results of the Saad study and other studies of patients with bone metastases with other malignancies. Zoledronic acid is approved by the US FDA for use in men with metastatic hormone-refractory prostate cancer and in the European Union for any patient with bone metastases, including prostate cancer patients,because of the beneficial impact of zoledronic acid on skeletal-related events. There is no validated method to determine which patients might benefit most from bisphosphonate therapy in this setting. Many questions about the use of bisphosphonate therapy in men with prostate cancer must be addressed, both in terms of the use in bone loss and bone metastases. These questions include: What is the optimal timing of therapy? Which bisphosphonate is best? What is the best dose and dose schedule? Do bisphosphonates effectively decrease skeletal fracture rates in patients with osteoporosis? How long should patients receive therapy? Are bisphosphonate 'holidays' warranted? What are the long-term skeletal and renal toxicities? Is there a role for sequencing bisphosphonate therapy either before or after chemotherapy? Is bisphosphonate therapy synergistic with certain chemotherapy or other bone-targeted therapies? Which patients are the most likely to benefit from bisphosphonate therapy? What are clinically significant endpoints of bisphosphonate trials in patients with metastatic disease? Does inhibiting bone turnover also inhibit formation of bone metastases? Preliminary work in these areas has been completed, but more questions than answers are available. Given the rising costs of health care, it is imperative that these questions be addressed to best use the health care dollar while offering high-risk patients the best available therapy. At present, no data suggest that bisphosphonates should be used routinely to prevent BMD loss in men with normal BMD or to prevent the development of bone metastases in men with biochemical relapse. Continuing trials may give us guidance in the future","","","","","","10.1016/j.ucl.2004.01.001 [doi];S0094014304000199 [pii]","Department of Medicine and Department of Urology, University of Washington, 825 Eastlake Avenue East, Mail Stop G3-200, Seattle, WA 98109, USA. thigano@u.washington.edu","PM:15123412","","","",""

Patients and Methods: Within 30 days of initiating androgen deprivation, the first of 4 planned doses of SUP 153Sm-EDTMP given every 12 weeks was administered. Growth factors were not permitted. The first cohort of 6 patients received SUP 153Sm-EDTMP at 2 mCi/kg per dose; 3 patients completed all 4 doses and 3 received 3 doses. Results: There were 7 episodes of grade 3 neutropenia and 1 each of grade 3 and 4 thrombocytopenia. Of 6 patients in the second cohort who received SUP 153Sm-EDTMP 2.5 mCi/kg per dose, only 1 received all 4 doses. Four events of grade 3 neutropenia and 2 events of grade 3 thrombocytopenia were reported. The 12-week dose schedule resulted in persistent low-grade thrombocytopenia and/or leukopenia, which prevented administration of all 4 planned doses. As a result, the dose of SUP 153Sm-EDTMP was decreased to 2 mCi/kg for a total of 3 doses administered every 16 weeks. Five of 6 patients in this cohort received all 3 doses of SUP 153Sm-EDTMP. There were 7 episodes of reversible grade 3 neutropenia. For all 18 patients on the study, there were no drug-related serious adverse events or grade 4 nonhemmatologic toxicities.

The safety and efficacy of sipuleucel-T was evaluated in 2 identically designed, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (D9901 and D9902A) conducted in men with advanced prostate cancer. METHODS: A total of 225 patients were randomized in D9901 or D9902A to sipuleucel-T (n = 147) or placebo (n = 78), given as 3 intravenous infusions approximately 2 weeks apart. Patients were followed for survival until death or a prespecified cutoff of 36 months after randomization. RESULTS: In the integrated analysis of D9901 and D9902A, patients randomized to sipuleucel-T demonstrated a 33% reduction in the risk of death (hazard ratio, 1.50; 95% confidence interval, 1.10-2.05; P = .011; log-rank). The treatment effect remained strong after performing adjustments for imbalances in baseline prognostic factors, poststudy treatment chemotherapy use, and non-prostate cancer-related deaths. Additional support for the activity of sipuleucel-T is provided by the correla tion between a measure of the product's potency, CD54 up-regulation, and overall survival. The most common adverse events associated with treatment were chills, pyrexia, headache, asthenia, dyspnea, vomiting, and tremor. These events were primarily grade 1 and 2, with durations of 1 to 2 days. CONCLUSIONS: The integrated results of D9901 and D9902A demonstrate a survival benefit for patients treated with sipuleucel-T compared with those treated with placebo. The generally modest toxicity profile, coupled with the survival benefit, suggests a favorable risk-benefit ratio for sipuleucel-T in patients with advanced prostate cancer.

Multivariate Cox regression model analyses of the pretreatment PSA level (>20 ng/ml n = 16 vs. ?20 ng/ml n = 23), grade (G8 or more n = 11 vs. G7 or less n = 28) and modality (LHRH group n = 19 vs. EMP group n = 20) revealed these factors to be independent predictors of PSA relapse after treat ment: pretreatment PSA had a relative risk of 3.84 (95% CI: 1.003-14.722), grade had a relative risk of 4.29 (95% CI: 1.093-16.824), and modality had a relative risk of 8.01 (95% CI: 1.867-34.361). No severe toxicities were observed in either group. Conclusions: The present results indicate that the combination of neoadjuvant ADT plus EMP combined with 3D-CRT sustains freedom from PSA relapse in patients with intermediate- to high-risk prostate c ancer. However, this regimen is insufficient for preventing biochemical failure, and an additional intervention such as adjuvant ADT, radiation dose escalation, or both, is required, especially for patients with a pretreatment PSA level of more than 20 ng/ml and high-grade cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with bone metastases treated with RT were eligible. Worst pain scores and analgesic consumption were collected before, daily during, and for 10 days after treatment. Pain flare was defined as a 2-point increase in the worst pain score (0-10) compared to baseline with no decrease in analgesic intake, or a 25% increase in analgesic intake with no decrease in worst pain score. Pain flare was distinguished from progression of pain by requiring the worst pain score and analgesic intake return to baseline levels after the increase/flare (within the 10-day follow-up period). RESULTS: A total of 111 patients from three cancer centers were evaluable. There were 50 male and 61 female patients with a median age of 62 years (range, 40-89 years). The primary cancers were mainly breast, lung, and prostate. Most patients received a single 8 Gy (64%) or 20 Gy in five fractions (25%). The overall pain flare incidence was 44/111 (40%) during RT and within 10 days following the completion of RT. Patients treated with a single 8 Gy reported a pain flare incidence of 39% (27/70) and, with multiple fractions, 41% (17/41). CONCLUSION: More than one third of the enrolled patients experienced a pain flare. Identifying at-risk individuals and managing potential pain flares is crucial to achieve an optimal level of care","","","","","","S0360-3016(08)03689-4 [pii];10.1016/j.ijrobp.2008.10.044 [doi]","Department of Radiation Oncology, Odette Cancer Centre, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada","PM:19167840","","","",""

prostate or renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The role of biphosphonates in ADT-induced osteoporosis and delay of skeletal-related events (SREs) in metastatic bone disease is discussed. A brief overview on the proposed modes of action is given. Methods: Literature search of PubMed documented publications and abstracts from meetings. Results: Among the biphosphonates currently available, zoledronic acid is the only one known to be capable of delaying SREs in RCC and prostate cancer patients. Zoledronic acid counteracts cancer treatment-induced osteoporosis in men with prostate malignancies. The antitumor activity of biphosphonates found in vitro and in vivo is intriguing and has to be further assessed in clinical studies. Conclusion: Due to its unique properties, zoledronic acid is a breakthrough in the management of metastatic bone disease in patients with advanced prostate cancer and RCC. It significantly improves the patients' quality of life, drastically prolongs time to first SRE, and showed a positive but not significant effect on survival. Copyright (c) 2006 S.

Design: Case-control study nested in longitudinal cohort. Setting: Vasterbotten Intervention Project cohort, Umea, Sweden. Participants: 540 cases and 1034 controls matched for age and date of blood draw. Main outcome measure: Validity of prostate specific antigen for prediction of subsequent prostate cancer diagnosis by record linkage to cancer registry. Results: Blood samples were drawn on average 7.1 (SD 3.7) years before diagnosis. The area under the curve for prostate specific antigen was 0.84 (95% confidence interval 0.82 to 0.86). At prostate specific antigen cut-off values of 3, 4, and 5 ng/ml, sensitivity estimates were 59%, 44%, and 33%, and specificity estimates were 87%, 92%, and 95%. The positive likelihood ratio commonly considered to 'rule in disease' is 10; in this study the positive likelihood ratios were 4.5, 5.5, and 6.4 for prostate specific antigen cut-off values of 3, 4, and 5 ng/ml. The negative likelihood ratio commonly considered to 'rule out disease' is 0.1; in this study the negative likelihood ratios were 0.47, 0.61, and 0.70 for prostate specific antigen cut-off values of 3, 4, and 5 ng/ml. For a cut-off of 1.0 ng/ml, the negative likelihood ratio was 0.08. Conclusions: No single cut-off value for prostate specific antigen concentration attained likelihood ratios formally required for a screening test. Prostate specific antigen concentrations below 1.0 ng/ml virtually ruled out a prostate cancer diagnosis during the follow-up. Additional biomarkers for early detection of prostate cancer are needed before population based screening for prostate cancer should be introduced","","","","","","","","","","","",""

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 19 hormone-refractory prostate cancer patients with bone metastases were enrolled. All patients received up to six infusions of zoledronic acid (4 mg, given intravenously over 15 minutes, every 3-4 weeks). Safety was assessed by monitoring adverse events and serum creatinine levels. Efficacy was assessed by monitoring skeletal-related events, brief pain inventory score, quality of life score, type of pain medication, and analgesic score. Mean age of patients was 67.3 years (46-86 years), mean time from diagnosis of bone metastases was 27.6 months (0-117 months), and mean time from diagnosis of hormone-refractory disease was 7.5 months (0-26 months). RESULTS: There was no clinically significant change in serum creatinine levels. Eleven adverse events (musculoskeletal disorders and systemic disorders) in 8 patients were classed as having a possible relationship to study drug. Fifteen patients completed six courses of zoledronic acid infusion. There were no significant changes in the brief pain inventory composite scores, quality of life questionnaire scores or analgesic score. No new skeletal-related events developed during the treatment period. CONCLUSION: Zoledronic acid administered in this study as a 15-minute infusion demonstrated an acceptable and well-known safety profile in patients with refractory prostate cancer with bone metastases. However, prospective placebo- controlled clinical trials are required to elucidate the efficacy of zoledronic acid","","","","","","2007121001 [pii];10.3349/ymj.2007.48.6.1001 [doi]","Department of Urology, Urological Science Institute, Yonsei University College of Medicine, 3Ulsan University, Seoul, Korea. sjhong346@yuhs.ac","PM:18159593","","","",""

It may be delivered as a localised low dose treatment for localised bone pain or systemically for more widespread symptoms using hemibody external beam radiotherapy or intravenous bone-seeking radioisotopes. Bisphosphonates have been shown to reduce morbidity from bone metastases when given to patients with asymptomatic disease from myeloma and primary breast and prostate cancers. They also reduce metastatic bone pain in these sites. In the absence of randomised data comparing radiotherapy with bisphosphonates in the same clinical setting, comparison of the response rates from individual trials of the two modalities suggests that the overall pain response in all tumour types from radiotherapy is around 80% compared to a similar rate in myeloma with bisphosphonates but only 40% in solid tumours. Optimal use of the two modalities requires further investigation but since they have different dose limiting toxicities their incorporation in a combined modality approach to metastatic bone pain is rational using the concepts of additive effect and spatial co-operation in which bisphosphonates provide background control alongside acute pain relief using radiotherapy. They are also an important alternative for bone pain where radiation tolerance has been reached or radiotherapy is not readily available","","","","","","S0305737203000136 [pii]","Consultant Clinical Oncologist, Reader in Oncology, Mount Vernon Hospital, Rickmansworth Road, HA6 2RN, Northwood, Middlesex, UK. peterhoskin@hotmail.com","PM:12927572","","","",""

Although emerging surgical techniques facilitate stabilization of the collapsed spine, surgical candidates should be carefully selected. However, the lack of confirmed criteria to determine survival of these patients makes selection for surgery difficult. Clinical symptoms have been considered possible factors associated with prognosis, but their relevance has not been confirmed because of inadequate power for proper statistical analysis. We retrospectively reviewed 165 patients who had surgery for spinal metastases from various cancers. Clinical symptoms including pain, paresis, and walking status were recorded. Multivariate analysis indicated that the histologic type of the primary tumor was the strongest prognostic factor, followed by preoperative paresis and pain. Myeloma, thyroid cancer, renal cell cancer, breast cancer, and prostate cancer had better prognoses than other kinds of cancer. Patients without paresis before surgery had a better prognosis than patients with paresis, and patients with no pain before surgery had a better prognosis than those with pain. Preoperative walking status was not an independent prognostic factor. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic study, Level IV (case series--no, or historical control group).

Castrate-resistant pca presents a spectrum of disease ranging from rising PSA levels in the absence of metastases or symptoms and despite androgen-deprivation therapy, to metastases and significant debilitation from cancer symptoms. Castrate-resistant PCa is usually suspected in patients with new symptoms on androgen deprivation therapy, with a rising PSa, or with new evidence of disease on bone scans or computed tomography scans. Institution of treatment and the choice of systemic or local therapy depend on a numb er of factors. This review discusses the various currently available treatments for patients with castrate-resistant PCa, from secondary hormonal manipulations to options for postdocetaxel systemic therapy.

Patients with metastatic prostate cancer progressing on androgen ablation therapy without demonstrable antiandrogen withdrawal response were treated with losoxantrone 50 mg/m2 i.v. bolus every 21 days. All of the patients had elevated serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) before study entry and had no prior chemotherapy. Forty-three assessable patients were entered. The median age was 70.6 years (range, 53.9-85.9), median Karnofsky performance scale (KPS), 70% (50-90%), and the median serum PSA, 173 microg/liter (12.5-11,140). The median number of courses was 4 (1-9). Five patients (25%) had a partial response as defined by >50% decline in the serum PSA. Two of nine patients with measurable disease had partial responses and three had minor responses. Thirty percent of patients had improvement in KPS and 37% had an improvement in symptoms with decrease in pain and/or decrease in analgesic requirement. Nonhematological grade 3 and 4 toxicities were one each of grade 3 headache, grade 4 hypocalcemia, grade 3 hyperbilirubinemia, and grade 3 dyspnea. Twenty-six patients (60%) had grade 3 or 4 absolute neutropenia. In conclusion, losoxantrone demonstrated a partial biochemical response rate of 25%, response in measurable disease sites in 22%, and improvement in clinical symptoms in one-third of patients. In this study, PSA increase was not necessarily associated with lack of palliative response","","","","","","","Ottawa Regional Cancer Centre, Ontario Cancer Treatment and Research Foundation and University of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada","PM:10778959","","","",""

Fluoride ( SUP 18 F) accumulates into the cortical bone, rapidly and intensely in reaction to a bony metastasis. In 2008, it has been granted a marketing authorisation in France, including imaging bone metastasis of prostate cancer. We report original clinical cases to illustrate its diagnostic performance. Whole-body MRI is developing and can also detect bone metastases. Recently diffusion-weighted MRI ( DWI) has been proposed to increase the detection rate of metastases of the axial skeleton, which are largely predominant in prostate cancer. Using either hybrid PET/CT or MRI requires mobilising equipments, which are less available and more expensive than the gamma-cameras for classical bone scintigraphy, in the aim to achieve superior diagnostic performance. A clinical study protocol (STIC) has just been accepted for public funding. It aims to assess the impact on patient management of the discovery of the first macroscopic bony metastasis and the efficacy of diagnostic strategies including those innovations, individually and in association. In case of prostate cancer with a high risk of metastasis, but without any proven bone metastasis and no typical pattern on bone scintigraphy, fluoride ( SUP 18 F) PET/CT wil l be performed as well as whole-body MRI. Histopathology and/or data of a 6-month follow-up will be the standard of truth to evaluate the adequacy of impact on patient management and the benefit / cost ratio of those examinations. With this prospective national study, we hope to demonstrate in the real world a clinical role for this radiopharmaceutical, which was proposed several decades ago, but benefits from a renewed interest thanks to the development of PET/CT imaging.

Radiotherapy (RT) is a recognised treatment for PC and high-dose conformal radiotherapy (CRT) is the recommended standard of care for localised or locally advanced tumours. Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) allows better dose distributions in RT. OBJECTIVE: This report evaluates the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of IMRT for the radical treatment of PC. DATA SOURCES: The following databases were searched: MEDLINE (1950-present), EMBASE (1980-present), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (1982-present), BIOSIS (1985-present), the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (1991-present), the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (1991-present), the Science Citation Index (1900-present) and the NHS Centre for Reviews and Dissemination databases (Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, NHS Economic Evaluation Database, Health Technology Assessment) (1991-present). MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations was searched to identify any studies not yet indexed on MEDLINE. Current research was identified through searching the UK Clinical Research Network, National Research Register archive, the Current Controlled Trials register and the Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Register. In addition, abstracts of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, the American Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology, and European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology conferences were browsed. REVIEW METHODS: A systematic literature review of the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of IMRT in PC was conducted. Comparators were three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT) or radical prostatectomy. Outcomes sought were overall survival, biochemical [prostate-specific antigen (PSA)] relapse-free survival, toxicity and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Fifteen electronic bibliographic databases were searched in January 2009 and updated in May 2009, and the reference lists of relevant articles were checked. Studies only published in languages other than English were excluded. An economic model was developed to examine the cost-effectiveness of IMRT in comparison to 3DCRT. Four scenarios were modelled based on the studies which reported both PSA survival and late gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity. In two scenarios equal PSA survival was assumed for IMRT and 3DCRT, the other two having greater PSA survival for the IMRT cohort. As there was very limited data on clinical outcomes, the model estimates progression to clinical failure and PC death from the surrogate outcome of PSA failure. RESULTS: No randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of IMRT versus 3DCRT in PC were available, but 13 non-randomised studies comparing IMRT with 3DCRT were found, of which five were available only as abstracts. One abstract reported overall survival. Biochemical relapse-free survival was not affected by treatment group, except where there was a dose difference between groups, in which case higher dose IMRT was favoured over lower dose 3DCRT. Most studies reported an advantage for IMRT in GI toxicity, attributed to increased conformality of treatment compared with 3DCRT, particularly with regard to volume of rectum treated. There was some indication that genitourinary toxicity was worse for patients treated with dose escalated IMRT, although most studies did not find a significant treatment effect. HRQoL improved for both treatment groups following radiotherapy, with any group difference resolved by 6 months after treatment. No comparative studies of IMRT versus prostatectomy were identified. No comparative studies of IMRT in PC patients with bone metastasis were identified. LIMITATIONS: The strength of the conclusions of this review are limited by the lack of RCTs, and any comparative studies for some patient groups. CONCLUSIONS: The comparative data of IMRT versus 3DCRT seem to support the theory that higher doses, up to 81 Gy, can improve biochemical survival for patients with localised PC, concurring with data on CRT. The data also suggest that toxicity can be reduced by increasing conformality of treatment, particularly with regard to GI toxicity, which can be more easily achieved with IMRT than 3DCRT. Whether differences in GI toxicity between IMRT and 3DCRT are sufficient for IMRT to be cost-effective is uncertain, depending on the difference in incidence of GI toxicity, its duration and the cost difference between IMRT and 3DCRT","","","","","","10.3310/hta14470 [doi]","School of Health and Related Research, The University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK","PM:21029717","","","",""

In metastatic cancer the response rate is 70% to 80%, with a median duration of progression-free survival of 12 to 33 months and a median duration of overall survival of 23 to 37 months. There are limitations to the continuous use of androgen withdrawal therapy, including significant adverse effects with long-term use. More significantly, the cell death process induced by androgen ablation fails to eliminate the entire malignant cell population; recurrent tumors are characterized by androgen-independent growth. The concept of intermittent androgen suppression proposes that the maintenance of apoptotic potential by successive rounds of androgen withdrawal and replacement might forestall tumor progression. Intermittent therapy offers quality-of-life benefits during the off-therapy period, as well as reduced cost of treatment.

Methods: FCH PET/CT was performed in 111 patients with prostate cancer using 200 MBq FCH: 43 patients [mean age 63 years; mean prostrate specific antigen (PSA) 11.58 mug/l] were examined for initial staging, and 68 patients (mean age 66.4 years) were examined for restaging (mean PSA 10.81 mug/l). FCH PET/CT results were correlated to histopathology, bone scan, morphology as revealed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and CT, PET/CT follow-up and PSA follow-up after therapy. Results: FCH PET/CT scans at initial staging correctly showed no metastases in 36/38 patients undergoing radical surgery, as confirmed by PSA levels <0.1 mug/l 6 months postope ratively. Lymphadenectomy was performed in 24 of these patients, revealing four false FCH-negative lymph nodes (LN). In one patient, only lymphadenectomy was performed since a FCH-positive LN was confirmed by histology. Four patients showed FCH-positive bone metastases, as proven by bone scan. FCH PET/CT scans at restaging correctly revealed local recurrence in 36 patients. No pathological FCH uptake was observed in 11 patients with biochemical recurrence. Twenty-three patients showed FCH-positive LN. Twenty LN were sur gically removed in seven patients. Histopathology verified metastases in all LN, but revealed two additional metastastic, FCH-negative LN. Seventeen patients showed FCH-positive bone metastases, as proven by bone scan or MRI. Sensitivity to detect recurrent disease was 86%. Conclusion: The results obtained using FCH PET/CT scans for initial N-staging were discouraging, especially in terms of its inability to detect small metastases. Recurrent disease can be localized reliably in patients with PSA levels of >2 mug/l. (c) 2007 Springer-Verlag","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We evaluated ixabepilone (BMS-247550) in patients with metastatic hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC). METHODS: Eligible patients had chemotherapy-naive metastatic HRPC, a Zubrod performance status of 0 to 2, and adequate organ function. All patients received BMS-247550 at 40 mg/m2 over 3 hours every 3 weeks. The primary end point was proportion of patients achieving a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response. RESULTS: Forty-eight patients with metastatic HRPC were registered. Forty-two patients were eligible, with a median age of 73 years and a median PSA level of 111 ng/mL; 78% had bone-only or bone and soft tissue metastases, and 88% had objective radiologic disease progression at registration. Grade 3 and 4 adverse events (AEs) occurred in 16 and three patients, respectively. All grade 4 toxicities were neutropenia or leukopenia. The most frequent grade 3 AEs were neuropathy (eight patients), hematologic toxicity (seven patients), flu-like symptoms, and infection (five patients each). There were no grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia or grade 5 AEs. There were 14 confirmed PSA responses (33%; 95% CI, 20% to 50%); 72% of PSA responders had declines greater than 80%, and two patients achieved an undetectable PSA. The estimated median progression-free survival is 6 months (95% CI, 4 to 8 months), and the median survival is 18 months (95% CI, 13 to 24 months). CONCLUSION: Ixabepilone has demonstrated activity in patients with chemotherapy-naive metastatic HRPC. Major toxicities were neutropenia and neuropathy. Further testing to define its activity relative to standard therapy is warranted","","","","","","23/34/8724 [pii];10.1200/JCO.2005.02.4448 [doi]","University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center, Ann Arbor, USA. mahahuss@med.umich.edu","PM:16314632","","","",""

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In all, 174 patients (mean age 74.6 years, range 46-90) with advanced prostate cancer presented over 2 years. Their forearm bone densitometry values were compared with those from 106 age-matched controls (mean age 74.3 years, range 66-90). RESULTS: Of the 174 patients, 73 (42%) were osteoporotic (t score <or=- 2.5) and 65 (37%) were osteopenic (t score - 1 to - 2.4). This compares with a 27% incidence of osteoporosis in the control group (P = 0.022). There were also no significant correlations between prostate specific antigen levels, Gleason score, tumour stage, biochemical markers and the presence or absence of osteoporosis risk factors. CONCLUSION: Patients with advanced prostate cancer requiring ADT have a high incidence of osteoporosis before treatment. In addition, osteoporosis in these men cannot be predicted from clinical or biochemical values. Therefore, bone densitometry should be used in all patients with advanced cancer requiring ADT, as the results have implications for the choice of cancer therapy and the prophylaxis for osteoporosis","","","","","","4471 [pii]","Department of Urology, Wirral Hospitals NHS Trust, Wirral, UK","PM:14616447","","","",""

METHODS: Serum samples from patients with painful bone metastases or symptomatic pelvic tumours due to HRPC were analyzed for prostate specific antigen (PSA), NSE and CgA before and after palliative radiotherapy. RESULTS: Forty-six of 138 patients (33%) had elevated NSE before radiotherapy, while 80 (58%) had elevated CgA, without correlation between the two markers or with PSA. After radiotherapy the median NSE level was significantly reduced (p=0.004), whereas CgA (p=0.009) and PSA (p=0.019) increased. In the multivariate survival analysis, a reduced performance status, >20 bone metastases on bone scan, low hemoglobin, and pre-radiotherapy elevated NSE levels indicated a short survival.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We review the chemistry, toxicology, pharmacology, and clinical study results submitted to support the supplemental New Drug Application for Zol for treatment of patients with bone metastases. Four- and 8-mg Zol doses were selected for Phase III trials based on bone resorption markers and clinical efficacy parameters. Patients with bone metastases were randomized in three Phase III studies (prostate cancer, solid tumors, and multiple myeloma or breast cancer) to receive 4 or 8 mg of Zol or to a control arm. The control was a placebo in the prostate cancer study and the other solid tumor study and was 90 mg of pamidronate (Pam) in the study of breast cancer and multiple myeloma. Studies were amended twice because of renal toxicity, initially to increase Zol infusion time from 5 to 15 min and later to decrease the dose in the Zol 8-mg arm to 4 mg. The efficacy end point was skeletal-related events (SREs), a composite end point consisting of pathologic fracture, radiation therapy to bone, changes in antineoplastic therapy for bone pain (prostate cancer only), surgery to bone, or spinal cord compression. This end point was analyzed either as the proportion of patients with SRE or time to first SRE. The breast cancer and myeloma study used a noninferiority statistical analysis methods to determine efficacy. RESULTS: In prostate cancer, both the proportions analysis and time-to-SRE analysis showed significantly less bone morbidity on Zol (4 mg) than placebo, but no significant difference between Zol (8 mg) and placebo in either analysis. In the solid tumor study, the time to SRE analysis but not the proportions analysis showed significantly less skeletal morbidity on Zol (4 mg) than placebo, and Zol (8 mg) was significantly better than placebo in both analyses. The breast cancer and myeloma study demonstrated noninferiority of Zol compared with Pam, with Zol retaining at least 49.3% of the Pam treatment effect previously demonstrated in placebo-controlled trials. Zol was approved on February 22, 2002, by the United States Food and Drug Administration for the 'treatment of patients with multiple myeloma and documented bone metastases from solid tumors, in conjunction with standard antineoplastic therapy. Prostate cancer should have progressed after treatment with at least one hormonal therapy.' The recommended dose and schedule is 4 mg of Zol infused over 15 min every 3-4 weeks. Increased Zol doses and shorter infusions are not recommended because of potential renal toxicity","","","","","","","Division of Oncology Drug Products, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, Rockville, Maryland 20857, USA. ibrahima@cder.fda.gov","PM:12855610","","","",""

In this study the authors set out to ascertain if surgery improves the quality of remaining life in patients with spinal metastatic and tumor-related systemic disease. METHODS: The authors included 223 patients in this study who were referred by oncologists and physicians over a 2-year period. All underwent surgery. Surgery was classified according to extent of excision ranging from en bloc excision or debulking to palliative surgery. All patients had a histologically confirmed diagnosis of epithelial spinal metastasis, and an oncology specialist undertook appropriately indicated adjuvant therapy in almost half of the patients. RESULTS: The mean patient age was 61 years. Excisional en bloc or debulking surgery was performed in 74%; the rest had (minimal) palliative decompression. All patients considered for surgery were included in the study. Patients presented with pain in 92% of cases, paraparesis in 24%, and abnormal urinary sphincter function in 22% (5% were incontinent). Breast, renal, lung, and prostate accounted for 65% of the cancers, and in 60% of patients there were widespread spinal metastases (Tomita Type 6 or 7). The incidence of perioperative death (within 30 days of surgery) was 5.8%. Postoperatively 71% of the entire group had improved pain control, 53% regained or maintained their independent mobility, and 39% regained urinary sphincter function. The median survival for the cohort was 352 days (11.7 months); those who underwent excision survived significantly longer than those in the palliative group (p = 0.003). As with survival results, functional improvement outcome was better in those who underwent excision. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical treatment was effective in improving quality of life by providing better pain control, enabling patients to regain or maintain mobility, and offering improved sphincter control. Although not a treatment of the systemic cancer, surgery is feasible, has acceptably low mortality and morbidity rates, and for many will improve the quality of their remaining life","","","","","","10.3171/SPI/2008/8/3/271 [doi]","Victor Horsley Department of Neurosurgery, The National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, London, United Kingdom. aibrahim@ion.ucl.ac.uk","PM:18312079","","","",""

A typical feature of this disease is its ability to metastasize to bone. It is mainly osteosclerotic, and is caused by a relative excess of osteoblast activity, leading to an abnormal bone formation. Bone metastases are the result of a complex series of steps that are not yet fully understood and depend on dynamic crosstalk between metastatic cancer cells, cellular components of the bone marrow microenvironment, and bone matrix (osteoblasts and osteoclasts). Prostate cancer cells from primary tissue undergo an epitheli al-mesenchymal transition to disseminate and acquire a bone-like phenotype to metastasize in bone tissue. This review discusses the biological processes and the molecules involved in the progression of bone metastases. Here we focus on the routes of osteoblast differentiation and activation, the crosstalk between bone cells and tumor cells, and the molecules involved in these processes that are expressed by both osteoblasts and tumor cells. Furthermore, this review deals with the recently elucidated role of osteoclasts in prostate cancer bone metastases. Certainly, to better understand the underlying mechanisms of bone metastasis and so improve targeted bone therapies, further studies are warranted to shed light on the probable role of the premetastatic niche and the involvement of cancer stem cells.

Treatment consisted of definitive radiotherapy in 14 patients and radical prostatectomy in 16 patients. One patient was treated with androgen deprivation alone. The mean follow-up period was 56 months. RESULTS: Of the 14 patients managed with radiotherapy, 1 patient developed bone metastases and died of prostate cancer, and 1 patient had a biochemical relapse 8 years after definitive radiotherapy. Of the 16 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy, 2 patients developed bone metastases, one of who died of disease. Three patients that relapsed after prostatectomy were successfully salvaged with radiotherapy. The patient that was treated with androgen deprivation alone developed bone metastases at 10 months, was treated with chemotherapy, and was alive after 22 months. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that PDA is a cancer with a behavior similar to that of high Gleason grade acinar carcinoma. Good local control can be achieved by either radiation or surgery.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: The charts of 134 prostate cancer patients, who were treated with pelvic radiotherapy between 1998 and 2007 were retrospectively reviewed. IF was diagnosed by bone scan and/or CT and/or MRI. The cumulative incidence of symptomatic IF was estimated by actuarial methods. RESULTS: Eight patients were identified with symptomatic IF after a median follow-up period of 68 months (range, 12-116 months). The 5-year cumulative incidence of symptomatic IF was 6.8%. All patients presented with lower back pain. Insufficiency fracture developed at a median time of 20 months after the end of radiotherapy and was managed conservatively without any need for hospitalization. Three patients were thought to have metastatic disease because of increased uptake in their bone scans. However, subsequent CT and MR imaging revealed characteristic changes of IF, avoiding any further intervention. No predisposing factors for development of IF could be identified.

Screening for prostate cancer has generated considerable debate within the medical and broader community, as demonstrated by the varying recommendations made by medical organizations and governed by national policies. Much of this debate is due to the limited availability of high quality research and the influence of false-positive or false-negative results generated by use of the screening techniques such as the digital rectal examination (DRE) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test. Our 2006 Cochrane review identified insufficient evidence to either support, or refute, the use of routine mass, selective or opportunistic screening for prostate cancer. This article is an update of that review. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether screening for prostate cancer reduces prostate cancer-specific mortality, all-cause mortality, and its impact on quality of life, including adverse events. SEARCH STRATEGY: An updated search of electronic databases (PROSTATE register, CENTRAL the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CANCERLIT and the NHS EED) was performed, in addition to hand searching of specific journals and bibliographies in an effort to identify both published and unpublished trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of screening versus no screening for prostate cancer were eligible for inclusion in this review. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The original search (2006) identified 99 potentially relevant articles that were selected for full text review. From these citations, two RCTs were identified as meeting the inclusion criteria. In this updated version of the review, the updated search identified a further 106 potentially relevant articles. From these 106 citations, a further 3 RCTs were identified as meeting the inclusion criteria. Data from the trials were independently extracted by two authors. MAIN RESULTS: Five RCTs with a total of 341,351 participants were included in this review. All involved PSA testing, though the interval and threshold for further evaluation varied across trials. The age of participants ranged from 50 to 74 years and duration of follow up from 7 to15 years. The methodological quality of three of the studies was assessed as posing a high risk of bias. Our analysis of the five studies showed no statistically significant reduction in prostate cancer-specific or all-cause mortality among the whole population of men randomised to screening versus controls. A preplanned analysis of a 'core' age group of men aged 55 to 69 from the largest trial (ERSPC) reported a significant 20% relative reduction in prostate cancer-specific mortality; (95% CI 0.65 to 0.98) (ARR = 0.71 per 1000 men). Meta-analysis of the five included studies indicated no statistically significant difference in prostate cancer-specific mortality between men randomised to screening and control (RR 0.95, CI 0.85 to 1.07). Sub-group analyses indicated that prostate cancer-specific mortality was not affected by age at which participants were screened. Meta-analysis of two studies investigating all-cause mortality did not determine any significant differences between men randomised to screening or control (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.02). A diagnosis of prostate cancer was significantly greater in men randomised to screening, compared to those randomised to control (RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.72). None of the studies provided detailed assessment of the effect of screening on quality of life or costs associated with screening. Harms of screening included high rates of false-positive results for the PSA test (up to 75.9%), over-diagnosis (up to 50% in the ERSPC study) and adverse events associated with transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) guided biopsies such as infection, bleeding and pain. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Prostate cancer screening did not significantly decrease prostate cancer-specific mortality in a combined meta-analysis of five RCTs. Only one study (ERSPC) reported a benefit in a subgroup of men aged 55 to 69. Within this subgroup of men it was determined that 1410 men needed to be invited to screening and 48 additional men subsequently diagnosed with prostate cancer needed to receive early intervention to prevent one additional prostate cancer death at 10 years. Men should be informed of this and the demonstrated adverse effects when deciding whether or not to undertake screening for prostate cancer. Any benefits from prostate cancer screening may take up to 10 years to accrue; therefore, men who have a life expectancy less than 10 to 15 years should be informed that screening for prostate cancer is unlikely to be beneficial. SCREENING FOR PROSTATE CANCER: Prostate cancer is one of the most prevalent forms of cancer in men worldwide. Screening for prostate cancer requires diagnostic tests to be performed in the absence of any symptoms or indications of disease. These tests include the digital rectal examination (DRE), the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test and the transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy (TRUS). Screening aims to identify cancers at an early and treatable stage, therefore increasing the chances of successful treatment while also improving a patient's future quality of life. This review identified five relevant studies, comprising of 341,351 participants in total. Two of the studies were assessed to be of low risk of bias, whilst the remaining three had methodological weaknesses. Meta-analysis of the five included studies demonstrated no statistically significant reduction in prostate cancer-specific mortality (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.07). Only a preplanned analysis of a 'core' age group of men from the largest study included in this review reported a significant 20% relative reduction in prostate cancer-specific mortality. Among this 'core' group of men aged 55 to 69 the ERSPC authors report that 1410 men would need to be screened to prevent one additional death from prostate cancer during a 9-year period, which is also associated with 48 men needing to be treated for prostate cancer (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.98). Harms included high rates of false-positive results for the PSA test (up to 75.9%), infection, bleeding, and pain associated with subsequent biopsy","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We also wanted to determine whether technetium-99m ((99m)Tc) methylene diphosphonate (MDP) concentrations predict radiation doses of (186)Re etidronate in painful lesions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-eight patients with breast and prostate cancer were evaluated. Patients received therapeutic doses of (186)Re etidronate. The area under the pain over time curve (AUPC) was measured for 8 weeks after treatment. Response was calculated as the percentage of change in AUPC. Quantitative bone SPECT (QBS)-measured concentration of (186)Re etidronate was used for calculating radiation doses. Receiver operating characteristics curve analysis determined the radiation dose threshold that best separated responders from nonresponders. SPECT-measured concentration of (186)Re etidronate in the urinary bladder was correlated with its concentration in the voided urine. Concentration of (99m)Tc MDP was compared with radiation doses to painful metastases. RESULTS: The radiation dose threshold was 2.10 Gy. For a decrease of 50% in the AUPC, the positive predictive value (PPV) of this value was 75% and the negative predictive value (NPV) was 88%. For a decrease in pain of 33%, the PPV was 84% and the NPV was 81%. In prostate cancer patients only, the PPV was 81% and the NPV was 92%. The correlation between in vivo/in vitro measured urine concentration was 0.90. The correlation between (99m)Tc MDP concentration and radiation doses of (186)Re etidronate was 0.92. CONCLUSION: QBS-measured radiation doses of (186)Re etidronate in painful metastases are a good predictor of pain relief. Bone SPECT using (99m)Tc MDP predicts radiation doses delivered by (186)Re etidronate","","","","","","","Departments of Nuclear Medicine, Oncology, and Neurology, Rambam Medical Center, Haifa, Israel. drisrael@netvision.net.il","PM:10894875","","","",""

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were randomized to receive zoledronic acid 4 mg or placebo intravenously every 3 months. Lumbar spine (LS) and total hip BMD was measured using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry at baseline and at week 52. N-telopeptide (NTX) and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP) were evaluated at baseline and every 12 weeks. Safety assessments were performed throughout the study. RESULTS: Efficacy analyses included 106 patients and 109 patients in the zoledronic acid and placebo groups, respectively. At week 52, the least squares mean BMD percentage differences were 6.7% for LS and 3.7% for total hip (P < 0.0001 for both). In the zoledronic acid group, decreases in NTX ((-)14% to (-)28%) and BSAP ((-)31% to (-)37%) levels were significant and sustained; changes in NTX levels and LS BMD (r = (-)0.25; P = 0.04) and in BSAP levels and hip BMD (r = (-)0.28; P = 0.02) were significantly correlated. Only traumatic fractures were reported for 2 and 3 patients receiving zoledronic acid and placebo, respectively. One patient in each group experienced acute renal failure. Osteonecrosis of the jaw was not reported. CONCLUSION: Zoledronic acid (4 mg intravenously every 3 months) was safe and effective in preventing bone loss and reducing bone turnover in patients with prostate cancer when initiated during the first year of androgen deprivation therapy; patients with low baseline BMD experienced the greatest benefit","","","","","","","Staten Island Urological Research, NY 10304, USA. risraeli@urocancer.com","PM:17553207","","","",""

Materials and Methods: Using PubMed(R) we performed a comprehensive literature search to identify articles on bone mineral density loss in patients with nonmetastatic prostate cancer receiving androgen deprivation therapy. Pertinent articles were reviewed and evaluated. Results: Bone mineral density loss and related fractures were recently established as significant adverse events associated with androgen deprivation therapy. Patients with nonmetastatic prostate cancer receiving andr ogen deprivation therapy experience annual bone mineral density losses of 0.6% to 4.6% with the most significant loss within year 1 of therapy. In addition to calcium and vitamin D supplements, current treatment options for androgen deprivation therapy induced bone loss include synthetic estrogens, selective estrogen receptor modulators and bisphosphonates. Recent safety concerns have been identified, including renal dysfunction with intravenous bisphosphonates and osteonecrosis of the jaw with oral and intravenous bisphosphonates. However, minimal renal dysfunction and no cases of osteonecrosis of the jaw have been reported in this setting. Conclusions: Because the most significant bone mineral density loss occurs within year 1 of androgen deprivation therapy and most fractures in healthy men occur in those without osteoporosis, early intervention is warranted to prevent skeletal morbidity in patients with nonmetastatic prostate cancer receiving androgen deprivation therapy. Although the majority of and the most compelling evidence supports the use of bisphosphonates for preventing and treating androgen deprivation therapy induced bone loss, further study is needed to define the o ptimal regimen, timing of initiation and duration of therapy as well as long-term efficacy and safety.

Traditional castration-based therapies, although effective, have implications with respect to quality of life, causing loss of libido, impotence, fatigue, and reduced bone mineral density. Monotherapy with a nonsteroidal antiandrogen is an attractive therapeutic alternative to castration, offering effective therapy with potential quality-of-life benefits. Of the available nonsteroidal antiandrogens, bicalutamide has been most extensively evaluated in the monotherapy setting. Mature combined data (56% mortality) from 2 large randomized studies show no statistically significant difference in overall survival between bicalutamide 150-mg monotherapy and castration in patients with locally advanced, nonmetastatic (stage M0) disease. Survival outcome in patients with metastatic (stage M1) disease (43% mortality) favored castration, although the difference in median survival between the groups was only 6 weeks. Bicalutamide 150-mg monotherapy was associated with significant advantages compared with castration, in terms of sexual interest and physical capacity, in patients with either M0 and M1 stage disease. Data from a small subgroup of patients with stage M0 disease suggest that bicalutamide may also reduce the risk of osteoporosis compared with castration. Long-term therapy with bicalutamide 150-mg monotherapy is generally well tolerated, with a predictable side-effect profile. The most common side effects are male breast pain and gynecomastia. Emerging evidence also supports the use of bicalutamide 150 mg, both as immediate monotherapy and as adjuvant therapy in early stage (localized or locally advanced) prostate cancer","","","","","","S0090429502015765 [pii]","Department of Urology, University of Copenhagen, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark. piv@rh.dk","PM:12231053","","","",""

In addition, the first overall results are examined from the bicalutamide early prostate cancer program conducted at a median followup of 3 years, in which patients with localized or locally advanced disease were randomized to receive 150 mg bicalutamide or placebo as well as standard care. RESULTS: Mature data from phase III studies have shown that 150 mg bicalutamide monotherapy provide similar survival outcome to that observed with castration in patients with locally advanced (M0) disease. Moreover, 150 mg bicalutamide have benefits over castration in terms of quality of life, particularly sexual interest and physical capacity, and preservation of bone mineral density. In the bicalutamide early prostate cancer program 150 mg significantly reduced the risk of objective progression in patients with localized or locally advanced disease at 3 years of median followup, with the greatest benefit seen in patients with poorer prognosis.

Thirty outpatients with cancer were recruited: 10 with pain due to bone metastasis from the primary cancer site; lung (4), prostate (3), and breast (3) (M group), and 20 with primary cancer of the stomach (11), colon (4), breast (3), lung (1), and bladder (1) with no such evidence of skeletal-related events (non-M group). None of the patients in the M group either needed morphine for pain relief or had hypercalcemia, although all of them had been taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). During the study, they continued taking NSAIDs, as they had before the study. The level of urinary cross-linked N-telopeptides of type I collagen (NTx) at baseline was significantly higher in the M group than in the non-M group ( P < 0.01). Oral administration of etidronate (400 mg/day for 2 weeks) to patients in the M group significantly reduced bone pain 2 and 12 weeks after the start of treatment; however, the pain relief effect was diminished 12 weeks after the start of treatment, despite a significant decrease in urinary NTx level ( P < 0.05 by one-way analysis of variance [ANOVA] with repeated measurements). The present study provides evidence suggesting that patients with painful bone metastases from primary cancer sites may have a higher level of urinary NTx than those with no evidence of skeletal-related events, and that oral administration of etidronate at the dose we used may have the potential to transiently relieve their bone pain by decreasing abnormally raised bone resorption. Although the present study had a small sample size, and had no placebo controls, the results may be useful, especially as they raise additional questions that could stimulate further research in Japan","","","","","","10.1007/s007740200033 [doi]","Department of Sports Medicine, Keio University School of Medicine, 35 Shinanomachi, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo 160-8582, Japan","PM:12115069","","","",""

The efficacy of etidronate for involutional (postmenopausal and senile) and glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, as well as that for other skeletal diseases, was reviewed in Japanese patients. Cyclical etidronate treatment (200 mg or 400mg/day for 2 weeks about every 3 months) increases the lumbar bone mineral density (BMD) in patients with involutional osteoporosis and prevents incident vertebral fractures in patients with glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis. The losses of the lumbar BMD in patients with liver cirrhosis and the metacarpal BMD in hemiplegic patients after stroke are prevented, and the lumbar BMD is possibly increased, preventing fragile fractures in adult patients with osteogenesis imperfecta type I. Furthermore, proximal bone resorption around the femoral stem is reduced and some complications may be prevented in patients who undergo cementless total hip arthroplasty. Oral etidronate treatment may also help to transiently relieve metastatic cancer bone pain followed by a decrease in abnormally raised bone resorption in patients with painful bone metastases from primary cancer sites, such as the lung, breast and prostate. Thus, oral etidronate treatment is suggested to be efficacious for osteoporosis, as well as other skeletal diseases associated with increased bone resorption, in Japanese patients.

Several prostate-specific proteins have been identified and are under investigation. This review reports on prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA), a protein with restricted expression that may have prognostic and therapeutic utility. RECENT FINDINGS: PSCA is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored cell-surface protein belonging to the Ly-6/Thy-1 family of cell surface antigens, and a murine homologue has been described. It is expressed in the normal human prostate and overexpressed in human prostate cancers. Its overexpression has been correlated with increased Gleason score, advanced stage and bone metastasis. PSCA is co-amplified with MYC, an independent predictor of progression and death. PSCA may therefore be a useful predictor of tumor biology and a useful target of immunotherapy against prostate cancer. Evidence suggests a potential role in strategies employing cytotoxic T cell lymphocytes. Anti-tumor activity has been demonstrated with monoclonal antibodies in tumor take and established tumor xenograft models. Conjugated antibody has recently been reported to have anti-tumor activity in preclinical models. SUMMARY: PSCA may serve as a tool in refining the prognosis of an individual cancer and may be a useful therapeutic target for immunotherapy. Future studies will be required to confirm its clinical utility as a prognostic factor. Future animal and clinical studies will be required to test various immunotherapy strategies for safety and efficacy. The study of PSCA regulation and expression may provide information on normal prostate development and prostate carcinogenesis","","","","","","","Department of Urology, University of California - Los Angeles School of Medicine, Los Angeles, California 90095, USA","PM:12172427","","","",""

The inevitable progression to a hormone-refractory state is accompanied by an exacerbation of local symptoms and metastatic spread, principally to the bones, which has a considerable impact on quality of life and survival. Treatment of hormone-refractory prostate cancer is palliative, and surgery and radiotherapy are used for the relief of lower urinary tract symptoms and localized painful bony metastases. Systemic treatments are not widely accepted in this setting, but clinical trials have demonstrated the potential for bone targeting agents such as strontium-89 and the bisphosphonates to palliate painful bone metastases and to delay progression in certain settings. Chemotherapy with mitozantrone in combination with steroids has previously been shown to have palliative benefits and to delay progression. The additional costs incurred by the use of chemotherapy or bone-targeting therapies may be offset by gains in overall care with fewer in-patient admissions compared with steroid monotherapy. Recent clinical trials have demonstrated that docetaxel significantly improves patient quality of life, and importantly, increases survival. Future studies investigating the timing of chemotherapy, combinations with existing treatments or other novel therapies are underway","","","","","","4500880 [pii];10.1038/sj.pcan.4500880 [doi]","Cancer Research UK Institute for Cancer Studies, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK. n.d.james@bham.ac.uk","PM:16801939","","","",""

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the safety and efficacy of the specific ETAR antagonist ZD4054 in patients with metastatic hormone-resistant prostate cancer (HRPC). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised, parallel-group, multicentre, phase 2 trial in patients attending cancer centres with HRPC and bone metastases who were pain free or mildly symptomatic for pain. INTERVENTION: Patients were randomised to receive once-daily oral tablets of ZD4054 10 mg, or ZD4054 15 mg, or placebo. MEASUREMENTS: The primary end point was time to progression, defined as clinical progression, requirement for opiate analgesia, objective progression of soft-tissue metastases, or death in the absence of progression. Secondary end points included overall survival, time to prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression, and safety. Statistical significance was preset at 20%. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: A total of 312 patients were randomised (ZD4054 10 mg, n=107; ZD4054 15 mg, n=98; placebo, n=107). At the primary analysis, median time to progression was 3.6 mo, 4.0 mo, and 3.8 mo in the placebo, ZD4054 10 mg, and ZD4054 15 mg groups, respectively, with no statistically significant difference between ZD4054 groups and placebo (hazard ratio [HR] vs placebo for the ZD4054 10mg group: 0.88 [80% CI: 0.71-1.09]; HR vs placebo for the ZD4054 15 mg group: 0.83 [80% CI: 0.66-1.03]). However, a signal for prolonged overall survival was observed in the ZD4054 treatment groups versus placebo, based on 40 deaths. At a subsequent analysis after 118 deaths, this survival benefit was confirmed (HR vs placebo for the ZD4054 10 mg group, 0.55 [80% CI: 0.41-0.73], p=0.008; HR vs placebo for the ZD4054 15 mg group, 0.65 [80% CI: 0.49-0.86], p=0.052) but the differences in time to progression remained nonsignificant. Median overall survival was 17.3 mo, 24.5 mo, and 23.5 mo in the placebo group, the ZD4054 10 mg group, and the ZD4054 15 mg group, respectively. Discordance between results for time to progression and overall survival may be due to the sensitivity of the definition of progression. Adverse events were in line with the expected pharmacologic effects of an ETAR antagonist. CONCLUSIONS: The primary end point of time to progression was not achieved in this study, but an improvement was seen in overall survival in both active treatment arms. ZD4054 was well tolerated.

Zibotentan (ZD4054) is a specific ET SUB A receptor antagonist in clinical development for the treatment of hormone-resistant prostate cancer (HRPC). In preclinical studies, zibotentan inhibited ET-1-mediated changes in cellular invasiveness in vitro, and inhibited angiogenesis, metastasis and the growth of tumor xenografts in vivo. Consistent with its specific binding profile, zibotentan inhibited ET SUB A receptor-mediated antiapoptotic events, while allowing ET SUB B receptor-mediated proapoptotic signaling. In the clinical setting, the absence of zibotentan activity at the ET SUB B receptor was demonstrated by the stability of circulating ET-1 levels following single zibotentan doses up to 240 mg. In a randomized, placebo-controlled phase II trial in patients with pain-free or mildly symptomatic metastatic HRPC (N = 312), zibotentan was generally well tolerated, with an adverse effect profile consistent with its known pharmacological activity, the most common ad verse events being headache, peripheral edema and nasal congestion. Although there was no significant difference between zibotentan treatment groups and placebo for the primary endpoint of time to progression, there was a promising signal for prolonged overall survival with zibotentan. These results support the strategy of targeting the ET SUB A receptor in prostate cancer. Phase III trials are under way. (c) 2009 Prous Science, S.A.U. or its licensors.

In preclinical studies, ZD4054 inhibited endothelin (ET-1)-mediated changes in cellular invasiveness in vitro, and inhibited angiogenesis and growth of tumour xenografts in vivo. Consistent with its specific binding profile, ZD4054 inhibited ET SUB A -receptor-mediated antiapoptotic events while allowing ET SUB B -receptor-mediated pro apoptotic signalling. Evidence acquisition: The preclinical and clinical activity of ZD4054 is reviewed. Evidence synthesis: In the clinical setting, stable levels of circulating ET-1 following single ZD4054 doses up to 240 mg demonstrated the absence of ZD4054 activity at the ET SUB B receptor. ZD4054 is cleared principally via the urine, with a terminal elimination half-life of approximately 8-12 hours and with little accumulation after once-daily oral dosing. In a Phase 2 trial, patients with metastatic HRPC who were pain free or mildly symptomatic for pain were randomized to once-daily oral tablets of ZD4054 10 mg (n = 107), or 15 mg (n = 98), or matched placebo (n = 107). ZD4054 was generally well tolerated in this population, with an adverse effect profile consistent with its known pharmacological activity. The most common adverse effects were headache, peripheral oedema and nasal congestion. At the primary analysis there was no statistically significant difference in time to progression between the ZD4054-treated groups and placebo (hazard ratio [HR]: ZD4054 10 mg, 0.88 [80% CI 0.71, 1.09]; ZD4054 15 mg, 0.83 [0.66, 1.03]).

The diagnostic work-up for the locally advanced patient is distinct from that of early stage disease in several respects in that it is related principally to ruling out metastases. The typical metastatic work-up consists of a serum alkaline phosphatase, bone scan, CT of the abdomen/pelvis, and chest x-ray. Once metastatic disease has been ruled out, individual components of the management of locally advanced prostate cancer patients may include surgery (palliative or curative), external beam radiation therapy (with photons or particles) or brachytherapy (with low-dose rate/permanent or high-dose rate/temporary radiation sources), and hormone therapy. Unlike in early stage disease, observation/watchful waiting is typically not a treatment option in locally advanced prostate cancer. Of the curative local control modalities, the one most commonly used, and the one which has emerged as the clinical standard, is photon external beam radiotherapy (EBRT). Numerous randomised studies have shown that androgen ablation has an established role in conjunction with radiotherapy for locally advanced disease--the current standard of care is thus photon EBRT plus neoadjuvant and adjuvant androgen ablation. Long-term androgen ablation appears to be better than short-term ablation, even when hormone complications are considered. EBRT is typically delivered to the prostate, seminal vesicles and pelvic lymph nodes, although in some circumstances local fields to the prostate and seminal vesicles may be adequate. New treatment planning and delivery techniques, such as intensity-modulated radiotherapy and organ motion tracking, are being developed to reduce the morbidity of radiotherapy while permitting a higher delivered dose. Further work is necessary to determine the precise sequencing and duration of hormone therapy in conjunction with radiotherapy and the optimum radiotherapy treatment volume. Additional work is also needed to determine the precise groups benefiting from other local control modalities such as surgery and brachytherapy. Finally, novel investigational strategies such as chemotherapy and gene therapy are being applied in an attempt to improve outcomes of locally advanced prostate cancer patients","","","","","","2323 [pii]","Department of Radiation and Cellular Oncology, University of Chicago Hospitals, Chicago, Illinois 60637, USA","PM:16536635","","","",""

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The records of all patients with cT1-4NXM0 adenocarcinoma of the prostate treated with ADT as the primary initial therapy at the Portland Veterans Affairs Medical Center between 1993 and 2000 were reviewed. Age, race, Charlson Health Index, family history, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, PSA density, digital rectal examination (DRE) findings, Gleason score, and percentage of positive biopsy cores at diagnosis were recorded for 81 patients. Patients had a median (SD, range) age of 73 (5.6, 58-84) years, a PSA level of 14.3 (34.6, 1.4-252) ng/mL and tumours were classified as Gleason score < or = 5 in 9% of patients, 6 in 31%, 7 in 31% and 8-10 in 30%. Outcomes extracted were PSA progression, PSA nadir, bone fractures, local progression, distant progression and overall survival. RESULTS: With a median (range) follow-up of 54 (6-115) months, the incidence of local progression, distant progression, bone fractures, PSA progression, and death were 10%, 7%, 25%, 21% and 41% respectively.

In support of studies of the natural history of bone metastases and SREs in Danish prostate and breast cancer patients, we estimated the sensitivity and specificity of hospital diagnoses for bone metastases and SREs (ie, radiation therapy to the bone, pathological or osteoporotic fractures, spinal cord compression and surgery to the bone) in a nationwide medical registry in Denmark. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: In North Jutland County, Denmark, we randomly sampled 100 patients with primary prostate cancer and 100 patients with primary breast cancer diagnoses from the National Registry of Patients (NRP), during the period January 1st, 2000 to December 31st, 2000 and followed them for up to five years after their cancer diagnosis. We used information from medical chart reviews as the reference for estimating sensitivity, and specificity of the NRP International Classification of Diseases, 10th edition (ICD-10) coding for bone metastases and SRE diagnoses. RESULTS: For prostate cancer, the overall sensitivity of bone metastases or SRE coding in the NRP was 0.54 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.39-0.69), and the specificity was 0.96 (95% CI: 0.87-1.00). For breast cancer, the overall sensitivity of bone metastases or SRE coding in the NRP was 0.58 (95% CI: 0.34-0.80), and the specificity was 0.95 (95% CI: 0.88-0.99). CONCLUSION: We measured the validity of ICD-10 coding in the Danish NRP for bone metastases and SREs in prostate and breast cancer patients and found it has adequate sensitivity and high specificity. The NRP remains a valuable tool for clinical epidemiological studies of bone metastases and SREs","","","","","","","Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Aarhus University Hospital, Arhus, Denmark;","PM:20865091","","","",""

It is frequently underestimated by medical and nursing staff, only about 50% of patients discuss it with a physician and in one fourth of cases any intervention is proposed to the patient. The patients rarely expect fatigue to be a side-effect of treatment. The etiology of this common symptom, its correlates and prevalence are poorly understood. In numerous studies the level and time course of fatigue was demonstrated to depend on the site of tumor and treatment modalities. For example, psychological mechanisms have been proposed to explain fatigue in women receiving irradiation for early breast cancer, whereas decline in neuromuscular efficiency rather than psychological reasons can lead to the fatigue observed in patients undergoing radiotherapy for prostate cancer. Fatigue can affect global quality of life more than pain, sexual dysfunction and other cancer- or treatment-related symptoms. Several interventions have been tested in the management of radiotherapy-related fatigue and some randomized studies have been recently published. Although an optimal method has not yet been established, some promising results have been reported with relaxation therapy, group psychotherapy, physical exercise and sleep. Further methodologically correct studies are warranted to define better the causes, optimal prevention and management of this symptom. (c) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

Initial stages of metastasis are generally similar to those for most solid tumors; however, the mechanisms that underlie the homing of prostate tumor cells to the bone are not completely understood. Prostate cancer bone metastasis is also a microenvironment-driven disease, involving bidirectional interactions between the tumor and the bone microenvironment. In this review, we discuss the current understanding of the biologic processes and regulatory factors involved in the metastasis of prostate cancer cells, and their specific properties that promote growth in bone. Alth ough many of these processes still need to be fully elucidated, a better understanding of the complex tumor/microenvironment interplay is slowly leading to more effective therapies for patients with prostate cancer bone metastases.

METHODS: Included in the study were 98 patients with T1c-T3bN0M0 prostate cancer who were diagnosed between October 1997 and September 2002 and underwent high-dose-rate brachytherapy with external beam RT. Treatment consisted of external beam RT (four ports) to the prostate of 16 fractions of 2.3 Gy to a total dose of 36.8 Gy and high-dose-rate brachytherapy of 4 fractions of 6.0 Gy within 30 hours to a total dose of 24.0 Gy. No patient received adjuvant hormonal therapy after RT. RESULTS: The most recent prostate-specific antigen level was 0.0 to 3.9 ng/mL (median 0.4). Seven patients (7.1%) developed recurrence and treatment was considered a failure (bone metastasis in two and biochemical failure in five). The overall biochemical disease-free survival (bDFS) rate was 95.9% at 2 years and 92.9% at 5 years. The bDFS rate by T stage was 98.6% at 2 years and 95.9% at 5 years for Stage T1c-T2b and 88.0% and 84.0% for Stage T3a-b, respectively (P = 0.047). The 2-year and 5-year bDFS rate was better in patients with an initial prostate-specific antigen level of less than 20 ng/mL compared with 20 ng/mL or greater (98.6% and 97.1% versus 93.1% and 82.8%, respectively, P = 0.0261). Acute toxicity was mild to moderate (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group grade 1-2) and consisted of cystourethritis or proctitis in 29 (29.6%) of 98 patients. CONCLUSIONS: With a low complication rate and satisfactory bDFS rates, this combination therapy can be considered an alternative method for clinical Stage T1c-T3b prostate cancer and is expected to improve patient quality of life.

Patients suffering from metastatic PC are faced with serious decisions regarding treatment strategies. Therefore, QOL information has become a crucial element of decision making in this group of patients. The first objective of this study was to describe QOL in a group of patients diagnosed with metastatic PC and skeletal metastases. At the time of evaluation the patients had not received any treatment but were evaluated before entering a study of androgen-modulating therapy (the Scandinavian Prostate Cancer Group study 5). The second objective was to identify demographic and disease-related factors affecting QOL. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 917 patients with metastatic PC were evaluated using a well-described and validated questionnaire [European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-Life Questionnaire-C30 (EORTC QLQ-C30)]. The characteristics of the PC were noted, and simultaneously patients were evaluated with respect to use of analgesics, pain and performance status using a scoring system. Biochemical tests were performed when patients entered the study. A multivariate regression analysis was performed to analyse the correlations between QOL scores, patient demographics and disease-related data. RESULTS: The patients reported QOL scores significantly lower than those in the background population. Pain and fatigue were pronounced, whereas dyspnoea, insomnia, loss of appetite, constipation and diarrhoea were less prominent. Patients with high tumour grades, high PSPA scores (the sum of the pain score, the performance status and the use of analgesics) and those using analgesics had significantly lower QOL scores than the other patients. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with metastatic PC have reduced QOL. Our findings are in line with those of other studies of QOL among patients with this disease as evaluated by means of the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire. Baseline data from studies like this provide important information when treatment modalities for PC are evaluated","","","","","","R4Y65G5E5BR6Y124 [pii];10.1080/00365590410002528 [doi]","Department of Urology, Aalborg Hospital, 9100 Aalborg, Denmark. jonler @dadlnet.dk","PM:15764270","","","",""

In sera of 117 PCa patients (pN0M0, n = 39; pN1M0, n = 34; M1, n = 44), 35 healthy men and 35 patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia, bone formation markers [total and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (tALP, bALP), amino-terminal procollagen propeptides of type I collagen (P1NP), osteocalcin (OC)], bone resorption markers [bone sialoprotein (BSP), cross-linked C-terminal (CTX) and cross-linked N-terminal (NTX) telopeptides of type I collagen, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase isoenzyme 5b (TRAP)] and osteoclastogenesis markers [osteoprotegerin (OPG), receptor activator of nuclear factor kappaB ligand (RANKL)] were measured. tALP, bALP, BSP, P1NP, TRAP, NTX and OPG were significantly increased in PCa patients with bone metastases compared to patients without metastases. OPG showed the best discriminatory power to differentiate between these patients. Logistic regression analysis resulted in a model with OPG and TRAP as variables that predicted bone metastasis with an overall correct classification of 93%. Patients with concentrations of OPG, P1NP, tALP, bALP, BSP, NTX, TRAP and CTX above cut-off levels showed signifi cantly shorter survival than patients with low marker concentrations. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression revealed that only OPG and BSP were independent prognostic factors for PCa-related death. Thus, the importance of serum OPG in detecting bone metastatic spread, alone or in combination with other bone markers, and predicting survival in PCa patients has been clearly demonstrated.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study planned to recruit 1000 patients with painful bone metastases from four Norwegian and six Swedish hospitals. Patients were randomized to single-fraction (8 Gy x 1) or multiple-fraction (3 Gy x 10) radiotherapy. The primary endpoint of the study was pain relief, with fatigue and global quality of life as the secondary endpoints. RESULTS: The data monitoring committee recommended closure of the study after 376 patients had been recruited because interim analyses indicated that, as in two other recently published trials, the treatment groups had similar outcomes. Both groups experienced similar pain relief within the first 4 months, and this was maintained throughout the 28-week follow-up. No differences were found for fatigue and global quality of life.

Due to increased longevity and disease awareness, the reported incidence of prostate cancer is rising. Although patients who present with early, localized disease can be offered curative treatment, patients presenting with locally advanced or metastatic disease currently receive only palliative treatment. Due to the hormone-dependency of prostate cells, androgen ablation has proved successful in delaying the progression of advanced disease. Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists, LHRH antagonists, and estrogens are all effective agents for medical castration. Antiandrogens can also be used to block the effect of testosterone at target prostate cells. The main side effects of surgical/medical castration are reduced bone mineral density and impaired sexual function, reflecting the physiologic role of testosterone metabolites. Progression of advanced disease following androgen ablation is inevitable due to the development of hormone-independent neoplastic prostate cells. At this stage, the withdrawal of antiandrogen treatment can be effective, producing a se cond response and a concomitant fall in prostate-specific antigen levels. Other options to treat progressive disease include adrenal suppression and modern chemotherapy agents. In addition to treatment-related side effects, patients with prostate cancer often experience ureteric obstruction and hematuria, due to the enlarged prostate gland. Resulting bone metastases can cause further complications, including spinal cord compression, pathologic fr actures, pain, and anemia. The plethora of symptoms experienced by patients with advanced prostate cancer highlight the need for a multidisciplinary team to ensure that effective palliative treatment is given","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Clinical responder was defined as a patient with increased global health score more than 10 units and stable or decreased pain score without an increase in analgesic. In all, 17 patients were treated per protocol, and four were assessed as clinical responders. Six patients developed a reduction in ALP (median -26%, range -5 to -78%). All patients increased in PSA. At baseline, three patients had a negative Octreoscan and the patients with positive lesions, demonstrated uptake of low intensity. At baseline the CgA was elevated above the normal range in 15 of the patients, and during treatment five patients decreased their CgA to the normal range. Neither baseline Octreoscan nor CgA could identify the clinical reponders. A minority of patients improves their health-related quality of life.

To clarify the role of NSE in prostate cancer progression, we examined the relationship of NSE to clinicopathological parameters. METHODS: The pretreatment serum NSE level was measured in 104 patients with histologically confirmed prostatic adenocarcinoma (PCa) and 59 patients in whom prostate cancer was not detected (non-PCa). PCa patients consisted of 5 T1N0M0, 20 T2N0M0, 31 T3N0M0, 7 TxN1M0 and 41 TxNxM1 cases. RESULTS: Non-PCa patients had significantly higher serum NSE than PCa patients. Serum NSE in metastatic PCa patients was significantly higher than that in non-metastatic patients, while NSE did not significantly differ with regard to histological grade, or prostate specific antigen (PSA) response to endocrine therapy. In PCa patients, serum NSE was not correlated to serum PSA nor chromogranin A. In metastatic patients who underwent endocrine therapy, the higher NSE group had significantly poorer cause-specific survival.

METHODS: A retrospective analysis of the Center for Prostate Disease Research database was undertaken to identify patients who underwent radical prostatectomy between 1989 and 1998. Patients who developed biochemical recurrence (two prostate-specific antigen [PSA] levels greater than 0.2 ng/mL) and underwent either bone scan or CT within 3 years of this recurrence were selected for analysis. The preoperative clinical parameters, pathologic findings, serum PSA levels, follow-up data, and radiographic results were reviewed. RESULTS: One hundred thirty-two patients with biochemical recurrence and a bone scan or CT scan were identified. Of the 127 bone scans, 12 (9.4%) were positive. The patients with true-positive bone scans had an average PSA at the time of the bone scan of 61.3 +/- 71.2 ng/mL (range 1.3 to 123). Their PSA velocities, calculated from the PSA levels determined immediately before the radiographic studies, averaged 22.1 +/- 24.7 ng/mL/mo (range 0.14 to 60.0). Only 2 patients with a positive bone scan had a PSA velocity of less than 0.5 ng/mL/mo. Of the 86 CT scans, 12 (14.0%) were positive. On logistic regression analysis, PSA and PSA velocity predicted the bone scan result (P <0.001 each) and PSA velocity predicted the CT scan result (P = 0.047). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy have a low probability of a positive bone scan (9.4%) or a positive CT scan (14.0%) within 3 years of biochemical recurrence. Most patients with a positive bone scan have a high PSA level and a high PSA velocity (greater than 0.5 ng/mL/mo)","","","","","","S0090429502024111 [pii]","Department of Urology, Naval Medical Center San Diego, San Diego, California, USA","PM:12639656","","","",""

With failure of initial treatment, as indicated by rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, second-line hormonal therapy is usually instituted. Over the past several years, it has become increasingly clear that systemic chemotherapy has an important role in hormone-refractory disease. Phase II trials have demonstrated high PSA and measurable disease response rates with taxane single-agent and combination treatments. One recent phase III trial showed that doce taxel (Taxotere)/estramustine (Emcyt) significantly improved overall survival, progression-free survival, and PSA response rate compared with mitoxantrone (Novantrone) plus prednisone. Another phase III trial demonstrated that docetaxel given every 3 weeks plus prednisone significantly improved overall survival, PSA response rate, pain relief response rate, and quality of life compared with mitoxantrone and prednisone. On the basis of these findings, every-3-week docetaxel plus prednisone is now considered standard first-line therapy for metastatic hormone-refractory disease. There is considerable optimism that treatment can be further improved. Studies of taxane combinations with bevacizumab (Avastin), thalidomide (Thalomid), bortezomib (V elcade), antisense Bcl-2 oligonucleotide, mTOR inhibitors, epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors, and KDR inhibitors are under way. Randomized phase III trials in progress or planned are examining docetaxel in combination with imatinib mesylate (Gleevec) or calcitriol and docetaxel/prednisone in combination with bevacizumab and an antisense clusterin compound.

However, the initial phase of tumor cell dissemination into the bone marrow is promptly followed by the migration of tumor cells into bone matrix, which is a crucial step that signals the transformation of micrometastasis to macrometastasis stage and clinically evident metastasis. The migration of cancer cells into bone matrix requires the activation of local bone resorption. Such an event contributes to tumor cell hiding/ escaping from high immunologic surveillance of bone marrow cells. Within bone matrix, tumor cells are establishing plethoric cell-cell interactions with bone marrow-residing cells, ensuring their survival and growth. Recently, RT-PCR detections of tumor marker transcripts, such as PSA and PSMA mRNA performed in RNA extracts of peripheral blood nucleated cells and bone marrow biopsy, have enabled the stratification of patients with clinically localized prostate cancer being of high risk for extraprostatic disease and bone involvement. Therefore, it is conceivable that bisphosphonate blockade of bone resorption can inhibit the migration of tumor cells into bone matrix during the early phase of disease dissemination into bone marrow (micrometastasis stage). Consequently, assessment of the efficacy and efficiency of bisphosphonates to arrest the evolution of bone lesions in this particular clinical setting of patients with clinically localized prostate cancer and positive molecular staging status (high risk for bone involvement) is warranted","","","","","","S1528365802106677 [pii]","Department of Experimental Physiology, Medical School, University of Athens, Goudi-Athens, Greece","PM:12520083","","","",""

Stromal-epithelial crosstalk is integral to prostate cancer progression and metastasis, and androgen signaling is an important component of this crosstalk at both the primary and metastatic sites. Intratumoral production of androgen is an important mechanism of castration resistance and has been the focus of novel therapeutic approaches with promising results. Various other pathways are important for stromal-epithelial crosstalk and represent attractive candidate therapeutic targets. Hedgehog signaling has been associated with tumor progression, growth and survival, while Src family kinases have been implicated in tumor progression and in regulation of cancer cell migration. Fibroblast growth factors and transforming growth factor beta signaling regulate cell proliferation, apoptosis and angiogenesis in the prostate cancer microenvironment. Integrins mediate communication between the cell and the extracellular matrix, enhancing growth, migration, invasion and metastasis of cancer cells. The contribution of stromal-epithelial crosstalk to prostate cancer initiation and progression provides the impetus for combinatorial mi croenvironment-targeting strategies.

Unfortunately, androgen deprivation therapy is primarily palliative, with nearly all men progressing to an androgen-independent state. Hormone-refractory prostate cancer presents significant management challenges and is the focus of this review. RECENT FINDINGS: Investigations into the pathophysiology of hormone-refractory prostate cancer, the exploration of chemotherapeutic combinations, novel biological targets, skeletal protectants, and radiopharmaceuticals, as well as new prognostic tools are expanding the clinician's armamentarium and improving patient outcomes. SUMMARY: Bisphosphonates and chemotherapy are providing effective palliative approaches. Phase II trials of taxane-based regimens show higher response rates and longer survival than has typically been achieved with existing standards. Two completed randomized phase III studies to be reported in mid-2004 will more definitively answer the question of whether currently available chemotherapy can improve survival","","","","","","00042307-200405000-00008 [pii]","Greenebaum Cancer Center, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland 21201, USA","PM:15069310","","","",""

The aim of this retrospective study was to investigate the potential of ICTP as a candidate serum marker of bone metastasis in prostate cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Serum markers in 155 men pathologically diagnosed with prostate cancer were measured. The serum levels of ICTP, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and alkali phosphatase (ALP) were compared to assess the extent of disease (EOD) scores from bone scans and then analysed statistically. RESULTS: The serum ICTP levels were not well correlated with the EOD scores in the total group of men, men newly diagnosed with prostate cancer, or men previously diagnosed with prostate cancer who were followed up. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of ICTP (cut-off value, 5.0 ng/ ml) of the men newly diagnosed with prostate cancer were 78.6%, 88.0%, 78.6%, and 88.0%, respectively. In these men, the specificity and PPV of ALP (cut-off value, 335 IU/l) were 100%, whereas the sensitivity and NPV of PSA (cut-off value, 40 ng/ml) were 100% in this study. The serum levels of ICTP in the men with low ALP (< 335 IU/l) and high PSA (> or = 40 ng/ ml) clearly separated the men with or without bone metastasis, as judged by bone scans. CONCLUSION: We found that the ICTP is not a superior serum marker for bone metastases compared with ALP or PSA. Our study suggests, however, that the ICTP measurement is useful in a certain subset of men with the combination of PSA and ALP in distinguishing men with bone metastasis from those without","","","","","","","Department of Urology, Shiga University of Medical Science, Otsu, Japan","PM:16909972","","","",""

Docetaxel-based combinations could offer more promising and tolerated results. A phase II trial was conducted with the combination of zoledronic acid, docetaxel and estramustine. Eligibility consisted of metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma with objective progression or rising prostate specific antigen levels (PSA) despite androgen deprivation therapy. Zoledronic acid was given at a dose of 4 mg on day 1, docetaxel (25 mg/m2) on days 1, 8 and 15, and estramustine orally at 140 mg two times daily on days 1 to 21 of a 28-day cycle. Twenty-seven patients were enrolled between October 2002 and November 2004. Median age was 68 years (53-83 years). A total of 124 cycles were administered with a median of 4.6 cycles per patient (1-8 cycles). The major toxicities were grades 1 to 3 anemia (55%), fatigue (15%), alopecia (11%) and hypocalcemia (11%). Two patients presented with deep venous thrombosis and died from pulmonary embolism. Another third patient died from Stevens-Johnson syndrome and grade 4 hepatic toxicity. Out of the 25 patients assessed for efficacy, 13 (52%) had a biologic response (>50% PSA decline). Three (21%) patients among the 14 with measurable disease had objective response: 1 complete response (CR) and 2 partial responses (PR). Response duration was 2 months for PR and 4 months for CR. A total of 12 patients (48%) experienced clinical benefit with pain reduction.

However, whether bone resorption is reduced primarily by these particular drugs is difficult to evaluate because patients with HRPC are usually treated with secondary or tertiary hormonal manipulations including second-line antiandrogens, high-dose diethylstilbestrol, or low-dose dexamethasone therapies, some of which may also be effective. Thus, we assessed changes in the level of the carboxyterminal telopeptide of type-I collagen (ICTP), a bone resorption marker, before and after pamidronate administration in HRPC patients with increasing prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-one HRPC patients with bone metastases and increasing PSA levels were intravenously treated with pamidronate at a dose of 30 mg either every 2 or every 4 weeks. Pamidronate administration was started immediately after confirmation of three consecutive increases in the PSA level. RESULTS: In 14 patients (67%), the ICTP levels decreased after the administration of pamidronate, despite increasing PSA levels. In 7 of these cases, the ICTP levels were lower than those recorded for 6 months or longer before the start of pamidronate administration. The characteristics of the responders were compared with those of the non-responders. CONCLUSION: In 67% of the HRPC patients with increasing PSA levels, pamidronate reduced the accelerated turnover of bone metabolism caused by metastases of prostate cancer","","","","","","000100840 [pii];10.1159/000100840 [doi]","Department of Urology, Osaka City University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan. hidenori@msic.med.osaka-cu.ac.jp","PM:17495494","","","",""

Because retinoic acid may have a confounding effect on prostate-specific antigen, we incorporated a pathological end point into the outcome assessment of two sequential clinical trials using all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) and the combination of 13-cis-retinoic acid and IFN-2a (cRA inverted question markIFN). Pre- and posttherapy tumor biopsy specimens were studied for histological changes, apoptosis (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end labeling assay), and proliferation index (Ki67). Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) expression was also evaluated using two different monoclonal antibodies to its intracellular domain (Cytogen 7E11 and Hybritech PM2). Fourteen patients with androgen-independent disease were treated with ATRA (50 mg/m2 p.o. every 8 h daily) and 16 androgen-independent and 4 androgen-dependent patients were treated with cRA inverted question markIFN (10 mg/kg/day cRA plus 3, 6, or 9 million units daily IFN). Both therapies were well tolerated, with fatigue and cheilitis being the most common adverse events. Clinical activity, assessed by radiographs and serum prostate-specific antigen, was minimal, and the majority of patients progressed within 3 months. One patient with androgen-dependent disease had prolonged stabilization for >1 year. The majority of cases (95%) showed no gross histological changes and no difference in apoptotic or proliferative indices. Increased PSMA immunoreactivity was seen in seven of nine (78%) cases using PM2 antibody and in two of nine (22%) cases using the 7E11 antibody. Although antitumor effects were modest, the results suggest a role for retinoids in modulating the expression of PSMA on prostate cancer cells","","","","","","","Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10021, USA","PM:10741705","","","",""

To investigate the role of these polymorphisms in susceptibility to early development of hormone refractory prostate cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS The study included 175 histologically confirmed cases of prostate cancer and 198 age and ethnicity matched healthy controls. CASP9-1263 A > G polymorphism was genotyped using the polymerase chain react ion-restriction fragment length polymorphism method. CASP9-293 del/ins and CASP8-652 del/ins polymorphisms were genotyped and the deletion pattern analysed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. RESULTS Our results demonstrated that presence of CASP9-1263 G allele was associated with reduced risk for prostate cancer (odds ratio 0.6, 95%CI 0.39-0.92, P= 0.02). Other variant CASP9 was not associated with prostate cancer risk. Coincidentally, the presence of CASP9-1263 G allele was associated with increased risk for progression of prostate cancer to bone metastasis (odds ratio -2.28, 95%CI 1.14-4.53, P= 0.02). CASP8-652 (+/-) genotype was associated with increased hazard for early development of hormone refractory prostate cancer (hazard ratio 2.44, 95%CI 1.2-5.85, P= 0.045). CONCLUSION Our results support the hypothesis that variants of CASP9 may influence the susceptibility to prostate cancer and its progression to bone metastasis. CASP8 polymorphism may influence the progression of prostate cancer disease to a hormone refractory state. (c) 2010 BJU International","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ibandronate is a new generation of bisphosphonates (BPs) with demonstrated clinical benefit in breast and prostate cancer patients with bone metastases. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 32 patients with newly diagnosed NSCLC and bone metastases, 4 mg of ibandronate were administered, as a rapid 20-minute intravenous infusion every 3-4 weeks. RESULTS: A total of 189 infusions were administered over a 24-month period, during which a statistically significant decrease in calcium serum levels (p=0.03) was observed. The serum levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were also decreased, but not significantly. With regard to clinical efficacy, 24 of our patients stabilized or reduced their need for analgesic treatment.

We evaluated the activity of the following schedule: weekly DTX 30 mg/m(2) iv, daily EMP 10mg/kg po, and CBDCA AUC=6 iv on day 1 of a every 4-wk cycle. Treatment was continued until disease progression or excessive toxicity. RESULTS: All patients were assessable for response. A median of six consecutive cycles was administered per patient. Levels of prostate-specific antigen decreased by more than 50% in 95.0% of the patients. Consumption of medication for cancer-induced pain was reduced in 84.6%. Partial response was attained in 66.7% of measurable lesions. Of patients with bone metastasis, 8.3% demonstrated partial response. With a median follow-up of 11.4 mo, the median time to progression was 12.0 mo, and the median overall survival time was 26.6 mo. The predominant toxicities were grade-3 or -4 anemia in 32.5% of the patients, leukopenia in 20.0%, and thrombocytopenia in 17.5%. However, all toxicity was temporary and reversible with dose reduction or temporary cessation of chemotherapeutic agents. There were no therapy-related deaths.

Because tumor cells and tumor-associated endothelial cells express activated PDGFR, the primary target for imatinib has been unclear. METHODS: We selected multidrug-resistant human PC-3MM2 prostate cancer cells (termed PC-3MM2-MDR cells) by culturing them in increasing concentrations of paclitaxel. PC-3MM2-MDR cells were implanted into one tibia of 80 nude mice. Two weeks later, the mice were randomly assigned to receive distilled water (control group), paclitaxel, imatinib, or imatinib plus paclitaxel for 10 weeks (20 mice per group). Tumor incidence and weight, bone structure preservation and osteolysis, and the incidence of lymph node metastasis were determined. The phosphorylation status of PDGFR on tumor cells and tumor-associated endothelial cells and levels of apoptosis were examined with immunohistochemical analyses. Microvessel density was assessed as the number of cells expressing CD31/platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (PECAM-1). All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: PC-3MM2-MDR cells were resistant to paclitaxel and imatinib in vitro. Treatment of implanted mice with imatinib plus paclitaxel led to statistically significant decreases in bone tumor incidence (control = 19 mice with tumors of 19 mice total; imatinib plus paclitaxel = four of 18 mice; P < .001), median tumor weight (control = 1.3 g, interquartile range [IQR] = 1.0-1.9; imatinib plus paclitaxel = 0.1 g, IQR = 0-0.3; P < .001), bone lysis, and the incidence of lymph node metastasis (control = 19 of 19 mice total; imatinib plus paclitaxel = three of 18 mice; P < .001). Treatment with imatinib alone had similar effects, and imatinib treatment also inhibited phosphorylation of PDGFR on tumor cells and tumor-associated endothelial cells and increased the level of apoptosis of endothelial cells, but not tumor cells. Treatment with imatinib and more so with imatinib and paclitaxel decreased mean vessel density (three CD31/PECAM-1-positive cells, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0 to 9; and control group = 38 CD31/PECAM-1-positive cells, 95% CI = 17 to 59) (P < .001), which was followed by apoptosis of tumor cells.

Material and method: A total of 149 patients followed up in our department were classified into 4 groups on the basis of PSA changes: group 1; those with normalisation of PSA levels within the first 3 months, group 2; those with normalisation PSA between months 3 and 6, group 3; those with a decrease in PSA but not reaching normal range, group 4; those with no decrease. The gleason scores and the number of bone metastases were also compared between the groups. Result: The time to progression was significantly delayed in group 1 (mean: 23.3 months) compared to those with group 2 (mean: 16.9 months) (P < 0.02). The time to progression in group 3 (mean: 8.45 months) was significantly shorter compared to the first two groups (P < 0.001). Also, in patients with gleason scores 5-7 (grades 2) and gleason scores over 7 (grade 3) and group 1, the time to progression (mean: 21.2 months) was significantly delayed compared to those with the same gleason scores but with group 2 (mean: 13.4 months) (P < 0.001). Conclusion: The decrease in PSA level is more important than gleason scores in determining the time to progression. Early normalisation of PSA delays the time to progression, and when combined with gleason scores, PSA is an important prognostic factor in predicting the success of the therapy.

The incidence rate each year amongst age standardized males in the UK was 98.3/100,000. Increasing age is the strongest predeterminant for the development of prostate cancer. Virtually all prostate cancers are adenocarcinomas with their differentiation graded by means of the Gleason score. Since there are often no presenting symptoms, diagnosis is usually reliant on investigations such as digital rectal examination (DRE), the serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, PCA3 m-RNA levels and biopsies guided by a trans-rectal ultrasound probe. Staging consists of magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography for locally advanced disease and/or a bone scan for detection of bony metastases. Management depends largely on the stage of the disease. For localized prostate cancer, radical prostatectomy can offer a potential cure. Side effects include erectile dysfunction and incontinence. Prostate cancer is also radio-sensitive and can be treated by external-beam radiotherapy or brachytherapy. Hormonal therapy, such as luteinizing-hormone- releasing hormone (LHRH) analogues and anti-androgens are used in locally advanced and metastatic disease. Patients may opt for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) surveillance allowing other therapeutic options to be employed if the PSA starts to rise or the tumour progresses locally. Cytotoxic chemotherapy is increasingly being used for hormone escaped/resistant prostate cancer, and other newer treatment options are in the pipeline. The survival rate for all stages of prostate cancer is now extending. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved","","","","","","","","","","","",""

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In all, 610 patients with adenocarcinoma of the prostate (any stage; median age 72 years; median testosterone 3.93 ng/mL, median prostate-specific antigen, PSA, level 19.0 ng/mL) were randomized and received study treatment. Androgen-deprivation therapy was indicated (neoadjuvant hormonal treatment was excluded) according to the investigator's assessment. Three dosing regimens were ev aluated: a starting dose of 240 mg of degarelix subcutaneous (s.c.) for 1 month, followed by s.c. maintenance doses of 80 mg or 160 mg monthly, or intramuscular (i.m.) leuprolide doses of 7.5 mg monthly. Therapy was maintained for the 12-month study. Both the intent-to-treat (ITT) and per protocol populations were analysed. RESULTS: The primary endpoint of the trial was suppression of testosterone to <=0.5 ng/mL at all monthly measurements from day 28 to day 364, thus defining the treatment response. This was achieved by 97.2%, 98.3% and 96.4% of patients in the degarelix 240/80 mg, degarelix 240/160 mg and leuprolide groups, respectively (ITT population). At 3 days after starting treatment, testosterone levels were <=0.5 ng/mL in 96.1% and 95.5% of patients in the degarelix 240/80 mg and 240/160 mg groups, respectively, and in none in the leuprolide group. The median PSA levels at 14 and 28 days were significantly lower in the degarelix groups than in the leuprolide group (P < 0.001). The hormonal side-effect profiles of the three treatment groups were similar to previously reported effects for and rogen-deprivation therapy. The s.c. degarelix injection was associated with a higher rate of injection-site reactions than with the i.m. leuprolide injection (40% vs <1%; P < 0.001, respectively). There were additional differences between the degarelix and leuprolide groups for urinary tract infections (3% vs 9%. P < 0.01, respectively), arthralgia (4% vs 9%, P < 0.05, respectively) and chills (4% vs 0%, P < 0.01, respectively). There were no systemic allergic reactions. CONCLUSIONS: Degarelix was not inferior to leuprolide at maintaining low testosterone levels over a 1-year tr eatment period. Degarelix induced testosterone and PSA suppression significantly faster than leuprolide; PSA suppression was also maintained throughout the study. Degarelix represents an effective therapy for inducing and maintaining androgen deprivation for up to 1 year in patients with prostate cancer, and has a different mechanism of action from traditional GnRH agonists. Its immediate onset of action achieves a more rapid suppression of testosterone and PSA than leuprolide. Furthermore, there is no need for antiandrogen supplements to prevent the possibility of clinical 'flare'. (c) 2008 The Authors","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Treatment of non-organ-confined prostate cancer hinges on its androgen dependence. First-line therapeutic strategies suppress androgen receptor (AR) activity, via androgen ablation and direct AR antagonists, whereas initially effective, incurable, 'castration-resistant' tumors arise as a result of resurgent AR activity. Alterations of AR and/or associated regulatory networks are known to restore receptor activity and support resultant therapy-resistant tumor progression. However, r ecent evidence also reveals an unexpected contribution of the AR ligand, indicating that alterations in pathways controlling androgen synthesis support castration-resistant AR activity. In this report, the mechanisms underlying the lethal pairing of AR deregulation and aberrant androgen synthesis in prostate cancer progression will be discussed.

Background: Zoledronic acid reduces the levels of bone markers and the risk of skeletal complications in patients with bone metastases. Recently, a correlation between the levels of biochemical markers of bone metabolism and the risk of clinical complications (ie, skeletal complications, disease progression, and death) in patients with bone metastases has been reported. The effect of zoledronic acid on bone marker levels was assessed in patients with bone metastases from breast cancer in a multicenter randomized trial conducted in Japan. Methods: Women with bone metastases secondary to breast cancer (N = 228) were randomized to 4 mg zoledronic acid (n = 114) or placebo (n = 114) every 4 weeks for 1 year. Levels of urinary N-telopeptide (NTX), a sensitive marker of bone resorption, were measured at baseline and regularly throughout the study. Results: The table shows that zoledronic acid reduced NTX levels in patients compared with placebo. Patients treated with zoledronic acid had a mean decrease of 61% from baseline NTX levels at week 2. This decrease was maintained throughout the study in this treatment group and was 54% at week 52. In contrast, patients in the placebo group had a mean increase of 27% from baseline NTX levels at week 2, and levels of NTX continued to increase during the study, reaching 146% above baseline at week 52. Conclusions: This analysis shows that treatment with zoledronic acid reduced NTX levels in patients with bone metastases from breast cancer compared with placebo. These results are consistent with published reports in patients with prostate or lung cancer and are consistent with the significant reduction in skeletal morbidity observed in this trial in breast cancer patients. Zoledronic acid demonstrated a 39% reduction in skeletal morbidity in this patient population","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The purpose of this study was the investigation of the efficacy of docetaxel for Japanese patients with HRPC. Methods: Ten patients with HRPC were treated with weekly docetaxel at Tsukuba University Hospital and were evaluated for the responses with respect to serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA), tumor size and survival. Considering the ethnic balance, the dose of docetaxel was reduced to 30 mg/m SUP 2 weekly compared with 36 mg/m SUP 2 in the study reported previously. Results: A biochemical response (> 50% decrease in PSA) was observed in five patients (56%; 5/9) with an average time to progression of 4.5 months. In two partial responders as determined by PSA, respective metastatic lesions in bone and soft tissue were also improved. The estimated median survival duration was 6 months. Most of these responses were accompanied by a significant reduction in the requirement for analgesic agents. No severe toxicity of this regimen was observed, except for gastric ulcer in one patient who was excluded from the evaluation. Conclusions: Weekly administration of docetaxel as a single agent was associated with a high rate of PSA reduction. T his treatment is feasible for patients with HRPC, even those who have a poor performance status and extensive prior treatments.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Pretreatment bone marrow aspirates from 193 cT (1-4) pN0M0 prostate cancer patients submitted to neoadjuvant hormone therapy (mean, 8 months) followed by radical prostatectomy were immunohistochemically evaluated by anticytokeratin antibody A45-B/B3 previously validated for the detection of DTCs. Bone marrow status was compared with established clinical and histopathologic risk parameters. Patients' outcome was evaluated using prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood serum measurements as surrogate marker for recurrence over a median follow-up of 44 months. RESULTS: DTCs were detected in 44.6% of patients. Bone marrow status neither correlated with tumor grade and stage, nor with the pretreatment PSA risk category (all P values > .05). In the univariate Kaplan-Meier analysis, the presence of DTCs was a significant prognostic factor with respect to poor PSA progression-free survival (log-rank test P = .0035). Using a multivariable piecewise Cox regression model, the presence of DTCs was an independent predictor of PSA relapse (relative risk 1.82; P = .014). CONCLUSION: The presence of DTCs in the bone marrow of patients with prostate cancer before neoadjuvant hormone therapy and subsequent surgery represents an independent prognostic parameter, suggesting that DTCs may contribute to the failure of current neoadjuvant hormone therapy regimens","","","","","","JCO.2007.15.0441 [pii];10.1200/JCO.2007.15.0441 [doi]","Institute of Pathology, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany","PM:18794550","","","",""

Between January 1999 and April 2006, 99 consecutive patients with AIPCwere enrolled in this study. The median patient age was 70 years (range 46-86), and the median pretreatment prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level was 243 ng/ml (range 8.2-29600). Median follow-up was 41.9 months (range 11.4-170.4). Upon biochemical failure, patients were treated with oral low-dose DXM. A total of 40 of the 99 cases (40.4%) showed a >=50% decrease in serum PSA levels (PSA r esponders). Twenty-five cases (25.2%) showed a <50% decrease in PSA, and the remaining 34 cases (34.3%) had increased PSA levels (PSA non-responders). The median PSA progression-free survival was 3.0 (range 0-27) and 8.0 months (range 2-27) for the entire cohort and PSA responders, respectively. The PSA responders had a significantly increased survival (median 30.1 months) compared to the non-responders (median 8.8 months, P<0.001). Of the 34 patients who were under pain control for bone metastases before the administration of DXM, 23 (67.6%) were able to discontinue the regular use of analgesics. The PSA responders also showed an increase in hemoglobin levels. The change in serum interleukin-6 levels was significantly associated with a response to DXM (P=0.0065). Severe adverse events of DXM were rare. Clinicopathological factors predicting the PSA response to DXM were age, time from initial androgen deprivation therapy to DXM and PSA velocity prior to DXM. In conclusion, oral low-dose DXM led to an acceptable PSA response in patients with AIPC. Thus, this therapy may be an effective and safe alternative for the treatment of AIPC, particularly for patients who are not favourable candidates for chemotherapy","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS AND MATERIALS: The base case to be evaluated was of a man with hormone-refractory prostate cancer. The evaluated palliative treatments were pain medication only, chemotherapy consisting of mitoxantrone and prednisone, and single- and multifraction radiotherapy (RT). A literature search was used to generate the transition probabilities and patient utilities. Modeling was used to generate the cost estimates. Expert opinion was used to generate utilities and cost estimates in the absence of literature data. Second-order Monte Carlo simulation produced incremental cost-effectiveness scatterplots and 95% confidence ellipses. RESULTS: Pain medication had the least expected mean cost of all the treatment options at 11,700 US dollars but also the second lowest quality-adjusted survival at 5.75 quality-adjusted life months. Chemotherapy had the highest expected mean cost, 15,300 US dollars, but the lowest quality-adjusted life months (4.93). Incremental cost-effectiveness analysis revealed that single-fraction RT was the most cost-effective treatment, with a cost of 6,857 US dollars/quality-adjusted life year; multifraction RT had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 36,000 US dollars/quality-adjusted life year. Chemotherapy was dominated by pain medication. CONCLUSION: Within the limits of the established model, single-fraction RT was the most cost-effective palliative treatment compared with pain medication, chemotherapy, and multifraction RT. The use of this model allowed comparison of different treatment regimens that could never be evaluated together in a randomized clinical trial","","","","","","S0360301604009459 [pii];10.1016/j.ijrobp.2004.05.053 [doi]","Department of Radiation Oncology, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA 19111, USA. a_konski@fccc.edu","PM:15590167","","","",""

METHODS AND MATERIALS: RTOG 97-14 randomized patients with metastatic breast or prostate cancer to bone to receive 8 Gy in 1 fraction or 30 Gy in 10 fractions. Retreatment rates and overall survival were made based upon gender, marital status, and Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS). The cumulative incidence method was used to estimate retreatment time at 36 months from enrollment, and Gray's test was used to test for treatment differences within the same groupings. Marital status, gender, KPS, and treatment were variables tested in a univariate Cox model evaluating the time to retreatment. RESULTS: Married men and women and single women receiving 30 Gy had significantly longer time to retreatment, p = 0.0067, p = 0.0052, and p = 0.0009 respectively. We failed to show a difference in retreatment rates over time in single men receiving either 30 Gy or 8 Gy. Univariate analysis of the entire group determined patients receiving 30 Gy in 10 fractions significantly less likely to receive retreatment, p < 0.0001, with a trend toward single patients less likely to be re-treated, p = 0.07. CONCLUSION: Non-disease-related variables, such as social support, might influence the results of clinical trials with subjective endpoints such as retreatment rates. The statistically nonsignificant difference in the 36-month retreatment rates observed in single male patients receiving 8 Gy may be a result of inadequate social support systems in place to facilitate additional care. Patients receiving 8 Gy in a single fraction had significantly higher retreatment rates compared with patients receiving 30 Gy in 10 fractions","","","","","","S0360-3016(06)00653-5 [pii];10.1016/j.ijrobp.2006.04.005 [doi]","Department of Radiation Oncology, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA 19111, USA. andre.konski@fccc.edu","PM:16814950","","","",""

METHODS: A retrospective assessment of 1294 patients with newly diagnosed, untreated prostate carcinoma was conducted at the authors' institutions. All patients underwent a bone scan, serum PSA measurement, and core needle biopsy of the prostate. The receiver operating characteristic curve for identifying a positive bone scan based on serum PSA levels and a decision tree were analyzed to determine the expected 10-year cumulative cost and disease specific survival rate. Two competing strategies were used: PSA alone and PSA plus baseline bone scan. For the PSA-alone strategy, a baseline bone scan was performed only when the patient had a serum PSA level > 10 ng/mL. RESULTS: The proportion of positive bone scans in patients with serum PSA levels < or = 10.0 ng/mL was 1.33%. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.870. Patients with a Gleason Grade > or = 3 tumors or with a Gleason score > or = 7 had a higher proportion of positive bone scans. The 10-year disease specific survival rates with the PSA-alone strategy and the PSA-plus-bone-scan strategy were the same. The PSA-alone strategy was minimally cost effective, with a savings of $16.00 (U.S.) in the cumulative net cost per patient over the PSA-plus-bone-scan strategy. CONCLUSIONS: The current results suggest that baseline bone scans can be eliminated in patients with newly diagnosed prostate carcinoma in Japan who have serum PSA levels < or = 10 ng/mL. Apparently, it is possible to omit baseline bone scans for patients with a Gleason Grade < or = 2 tumors or with a Gleason score < or =6","","","","","","10.1002/cncr.10340 [pii]","Department of Radiology, National Defense Medical College, Namiki, Tokorozawa, Japan. nucleark@ndmc.ac.jp","PM:11920464","","","",""

Metastatic bone disease is frequently a challenging source of pain for patients with prostate cancer. The purpose of our study is to evaluate the analgesic efficacy of intravenously and intramuscularly administered salmon calcitonin in comparison to that of the usual nonopioid and opioid analgesics when administered to patients with bone metastases from prostate cancer. Methods. We evaluated 24 patients who underwent surgery for prostate cancer and postoperatively developed diffuse bone pain secondary to metastases. The patients were treated with intravenous and intramuscular administration of salmon calcitonin. The usual analgesics have a little or no effect ov er pain control in patients with bone metastases from prostate cancer. Their analgesic action lasts 3-4 hours, their effectiveness varies among patients and it is decreased by the time. The hormone calcitonin has the potential to relieve bone pain and achieve significant analgesia. We treated all the patients with 200 IU of salmon calcitonin per day-100 IU at the morning and 100 IU at the noon- diluted in 500 ml of a saline solution. The infusion rate was 50 drops per minute. Results. All the patients treated with salmon calcitonin had a significant reduction of their pain by the second day of the administration. Especially in some patients, the reduction was conside rable enough to allow their early mobilization. Conclusion. The results of our study indicate a significant reduction of pain in about 70% of the patients when they were treated with calcitonin. On the contrary, there was a little or no relief of the pain experienced by the patients when they were treated with usual analgesics, even with opioids. However, it is necessary to perform a trial with larger sample size in order to clarify the long term analgesic action of calcitonin on patients with painful bone metastases","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Eleven stage D3 patients with diffuse bony metastases, who had progressed despite initial responses (lasting < 12 months) to combined androgen blockade therapy and subsequently failed antiandrogen withdrawal, received oral dexamethaso ne (4 mg daily for the first month, tapered down to 2 mg after the first month and 1 mg after the second month, and continued on 1 mg thereafter) and lanreotide (30 mg im every 14 d) in combination with triptorelin (3.75 mg im every 28 d). Serum prostate-specific antigen, alkaline phosphatase, performance status, and bone pain were assessed monthly during therapy. Fasting blood glucose was measured biweekly, and serum IGF-I, T, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate levels were assessed at baseline, at response to the combination therapy, and at relapse from it.

The concept of antisurvival factor (ASF) therapy as a component of anticancer treatments aims at neutralising the protective effect conferred upon cancer cells by the survival factor(s) derived by the local microenvironment, in order to enhance the sensitivity and/or reverse the resistance of tumour cells to other anticancer therapeutic strategies. Herein, we review the translation of this concept from ex vivo studies to clinical applications in the setting of prostate cancer refractory to androgen ablation (stage D3). At this stage, which predominantly involves bone metastases, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) production (either growth hormone (GH)-dependent or GH-independent) can protect tumour cells from apoptosis, despite the significant suppression of androgens. The application of the ASF therapeutic concept involves the combination of dexamethasone (which suppresses GH-independent IGF-1) and somatostatin analogue (which suppresses endocrine, GH-dependent IGF-1) with the pro-apoptotic effect of the testicular androgen suppression by sustained use of LHRH analogues. In stage D3, patients who had failed anti-androgen withdrawal, chemotherapy and also had several other adverse prognostic features, the ASF-based combination achieved durable objective responses and major symptomatic improvement, paving the way for future applications of this approach. The ASF-based combination therapy illustrates a novel paradigm in cancer treatment: anti-tumour treatment strategies may not only aim at directly inducing cancer cell apoptosis, but can also target the tumour microenvironment and neutralise the protection it confers on metastatic cancer cells. The favourable toxicity profile of this therapeutic approach calls for its testing in a randomised controlled setting in metastatic prostate cancer and, conceivably, in other IGF-1-responsive malignancies","","","","","","10.1517/13543784.11.2.283 [doi]","Department of Experimental Physiology, Medical School, University of Athens, Greece. mkouts@medscape.com","PM:11829717","","","",""

We tested the safety and efficacy in stage D3 patients of the combination hormonal therapy, which combines administration of somatostatin analog and dexamethasone with standard androgen ablation monotherapy (luteinizing-hormone releasing-hormone analog or orchiectomy). Experimental Design: Thirty eight patients with stage D3 prostate cancer (mean age 71.8 +/- 5.9 years) continued receiving androgen ablation therapy in combination with oral dexamethasone (4 mg daily for the 1st month of treatment, tapered down to 1 mg daily by the 4th month, with 1 mg daily maintenance dose thereafter) and somatostatin analog (20 mg octreotide i.m. injections every 28 days). Results: Twenty-three of 38 patients (60.5%) receiving this combination regimen had partial responses [PR, >=50% prostate-specific antigen (PSA) decline], 9 (21.1%) had stable disease, and 7 (18.4%) had progressive disease. In 47.7% (18 of 38) of patients, their serum PSA levels decreased with treatment but did not return to their respective baselines until the end of follow-up (or death from non-prostate cance r-related causes). The median time-to-return to baseline PSA was 12 months (95% CI, 7-17 months), median progression-free survival was 7 months (95% CI, 4.5-9.5 months), median overall survival was 14 months (95% CI, 10.7-17.4 months), and median prostate cancer-specific overall survival (defined as time from onset of combination therapy until prostate cancer-related death) was 16.0 months (95% CI, 11.9-20.1 months). All patients reported significant and durable improvement of bone pain and performance status (for a median duration of 14 months; 95% CI, 9-19 months), without major treatment-related side effects. We observed a statistically significant (P < 0.01) r eduction in serum insulin-like growth factor-1 levels at response to the combination therapy. T levels remained suppressed within castration levels at baseline and throughout therapy, including relapse. Conclusion: The combination therapy of dexamethasone plus somatostatin analog and standard androgen ablation manipulation produces objective clinical responses and symptomatic improvement in androgen ablation-refractory refractory prostate cancer patients","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Herein, the molecular evidence documenting that bone metastasis microenvironment survival factors (mainly the paracrine growth hormone-independent, urokinase-type plasminogen activator-mediated increase of IGF-1 and the endocrine production of growth hormone-dependent IGF-1, mainly liver-derived IGF-1 production) produce an epigenetic form of prostate cancer cells that are resistant to proapoptotic therapies is reviewed. Consequently, the authors present the conceptual framework of a novel antibone microenvironment survival factor, mainly an anti-IGF-1 hormonal manipulation for androgen ablation refractory prostate cancer (a combination of conventional androgen ablation therapy [luteinising hormone-releasing hormone agonist-A or orchiectomy]) with dexamethasone plus somatostatin analogue, which yielded durable objective responses and major improvement of bone pain and performance status in stage D3 prostate cancer patients","","","","","","10.1517/13543784.15.7.795 [doi]","University of Athens, Department of Basic Sciences, Medical School, 75 Micras Asias, Goudi-Athens 11527, Greece. mkouts@medscape.com","PM:16787142","","","",""

The predictive value of flare response with regard to analgesic response was also studied. High-grade leukothrombopenias were observed after only 5% of injections. An improvement in quality of life was obtained in 65% of cases, a decrease in pain in 78% (31% complete response) and a reduction of analgesics in 60%. Efficacy was significantly better for pain decrease (P=0.005) and reduction of analgesics (P=0.018), and response was significantly longer (P<0.0035) in patients with moderate than in patients with extensive bone involvement. The flare response observed in 23% of cases was not predictive of pain response (P=0.919) or reduction of analgesics (P=0.353). A second dose prolonged analgesia in three-quarters of cases without any apparent increase in toxicity. These results confirm the benefit of SUP 89Sr chloride for the treatment of metastatic bone pain and suggest that internal radi otherapy should be started earlier. A bone scan could be proposed at the time of hormonal escape resulting in bone pain, and internal radiotherapy could be initiated when several metastatic foci exist, even if only one is painful. In this way, pain-free follow-up could be prolonged, and the transition to other therapeutic approaches, particularly opioids, delayed","","","","","","","","","","","",""

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analysed 82 patients with lymph node metastases at the time of surgery and who had a RP between 1993 and 2002. Data from clinical records and follow-up questionnaires were used. Overall survival, time to clinical disease progression and time to biochemical progression were used as endpoints to assess the outcome. Clinical progression was defined as documented local recurrence or distant metastases, and biochemical as an increase in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) of >=0.4 ng/mL. Variables analysed included PSA level, Gleason score before and after RP, clinical and pathological stage, number of positive lymph nodes and hormone therapy after RP. The statistical assessment included univariate regression analysis, and to analyse the distribution of clinical findings in different groups, Mantel-Haenszel statistics were used to test for differences in the numbers of patients. Survival and progression-free interval were assessed by Kaplan-Meier estimates and differences between groups calculated by log-rank statistics and Cox regression models. RESULTS: The median (range) follow-up was 55 (10-125) months. Adjuvant hormonal treatment was used in 77 patients, five of whom had immediate adjuvant radiotherapy, and nine delayed radiotherapy because of local progression or symptomatic bone metastases; five had no additional treatment. The rates for 5- and 10-year overall survival, clinical progression-free survival and biochemical progression-free survival were 84% and 79%, 83% and 77%, and 70% and 60%, respectively. Ten patients died (12%), eight (10%) of them from the cancer; bone metastases were detected in nine (11%). Local recurrences developed in three (4%) patients, 10 (12%) had a PSA increase of >=0.4 ng/mL alone and 58 (71%) had no signs of progression, but two died from other causes. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with prostate cancer who had RP and pelvic lymphadenectomy followed by adjuvant hormone therapy, and who had lymph node metastases at the time of surgery, had excellent overall and progression-free survival in the long term.

Of 574 high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) lesions on needle biopsy seen at our institution over 75 months, we identified 23 consult cases in which the differential diagnosis was cribriform high-grade PIN versus infiltrating cribriform carcinoma. Prebiopsy prostate-specific antigen (PSA) averaged 6.5 ng/mL (range, 0.3 to 37.3). A positive digital rectal examination (DRE) was present in 12 of 22 (55%) patients for whom information was available. Ordinary high-grade PIN was present elsewhere in the biopsy specimens in 32% of cases. The following architectural features of cribriform glands were evaluated: number (mean, 5; range, 1 to 21); largest size (mean, 0.5 mm; range, 0.1 to 1 mm); necrosis (14%); detached cribriform fragments (18%); stromal fibrosis (18%); and bilaterality (22%). Cytologically, there was cellular maturation toward the center of the cribriform glands (45%); identifiable basal cells on hematoxylin and eosin sections (36%); marked nuclear atypia (9%); and mitoses (23%). Nucleoli were not visible in 18% of cases, small in 36%, and prominent in 45%. With a mean follow-up of 13.8 months for those without progression (25.9 mont hs' overall follow-up), a repeat biopsy diagnosis of cancer was seen in 10 of 22 men [by report: Gleason score (Gs) 4 (n = 1); Gs 6 (n = 3); Gs 7 (n = 4); Gs 9 (n = 2); three biopsy specimens showed ductal features]. An additional two men developed bone metastases without biopsy. Overall, 12 of 22 (55%) patients had cancer on follow-up (one patient lost to follow-up).

The current study described the natural history of bone complications in men with prostate carcinoma who have initiated ADT. METHODS: Using 1992-2001 claims data from a 5% national random sample of Medicare beneficiaries, the authors identified men with prostate carcinoma who initiated ADT between 1992 and 1994. They analyzed inpatient, outpatient, and physician claims for bone complications over 7 subsequent years. They stratified the quartile of patients who survived longest into 2 cohorts: those who had received ADT for longer than and those who had received ADT for shorter than the median of 697 days. They evaluated the cumulative proportions of patients in each cohort with claims for pathologic fractures, osteoporosis/osteopenia, and nonpathologic fractures. RESULTS: In the 1992-1994 sample, 4494 men with prostate carcinoma initiated ADT. Of these, 1126 survived > 2028 days (5.5 years). During the first 3 years of evaluation, the proportion of bone events was similar for men with shorter durations of ADT and men with longer durations of ADT. However, by 7 years, more men in the longer ADT cohort (45%) had sustained at least 1 pathologic or nonpathologic fracture compared with men in the shorter ADT cohort (40%). CONCLUSIONS: In the current study, men with prostate carcinoma were found to be at risk for adverse bone effects from both the disease and the treatment. These longitudinal data revealed that fractures are common in this patient population and appear to be linked to the duration of ADT","","","","","","10.1002/cncr.20388 [doi]","Department of Urology, David Geffen School of Medicine and School of Public Health, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California 90095, USA","PM:15274067","","","",""

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using data from the MarketScan Medicare Supplemental and Coordination of Benefits Database, we identified cases with International Classification of Disease, 9th Revision codes indicating a diagnosis of prostate cancer who initiated androgen deprivation therapy between 1999 and 2002. The control group consisted of patients with prostate cancer with no androgen deprivation therapy use, matched by age, geographic region, insurance plan and index year. All had followup data for at least 36 months. The occurrence and cost of osteoporosis and any bone fracture were assessed using a propensity score matched sample. RESULTS: Of the 8,577 eligible men with prostate cancer, 3,055 initiated androgen deprivation therapy and 5,522 did not. At the time of androgen deprivation therapy initiation those on androgen deprivation therapy had more severe comorbidity (3.1 vs 2.6, p <0.001) and proportionally more bone metastases (2.8% vs less than 0.6%, p <0.001) but no difference in fracture rate. After 3 years of followup the androgen deprivation therapy group experienced significantly more fractures (18.7% vs 14.6%, p <0.001). The mean unadjusted total cost of health care during the 36-month period was $48,350 per person for cases and $26,097 for controls. CONCLUSIONS: Among men with prostate cancer, those on androgen deprivation therapy cost the health care system almost twice as much as those not on androgen deprivation therapy. After controlling for differences in health status, the majority of the excess cost is attributable to androgen deprivation therapy and then to a lesser extent, the fractures. These results suggest that the bone complications of osteoporosis and fractures in men on androgen deprivation therapy have important economic consequences","","","","","","S0022-5347(07)01406-1 [pii];10.1016/j.juro.2007.05.135 [doi]","Division of Urology, Department of Surgery, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 27609, USA. krups001@mc.duke.edu","PM:17706711","","","",""

Patients and methods: Through June 1999 and May 2001, 100 patients of stage D2 CaP were randomized into placebo (44) and flutamide (42) group after orchiectomy in double blind fashion using the strictest criteria. All men and histological proof of CaP with bone metastasis demonstrated on imaging: bone scan and skeletal survey. These patients were further substratified according to number of bony metastases into high volume disease (HVD>5 sites) and low volume disease (LVD<5 sites). The follow-up was at 3 month intervals. Criteria for decoding were clinical or serological progression and serious adverse effects. Results: Of the 100 patients recruited in the trial, 48 had HVD and 52 LVD. Treatmentwise they were almost equally distributed in flutamide group and placebo group. In the follow-up ranging from 6 to 24 months, 30 out of 100 patients (30%) required decoding, reasons for decoding were progression of disease in 25 and serious adverse effects in remaining 5. These 25 patients were further analyzed according to treatment group, volume of metastasis pre-orchiectomy PSA and Gleason score. We observed that number of bony metastases had impact over the duration of response to hormonal therapy. Discussion: We initiated this simple trial to address the issue of benefit of total androgen blockade over monotherapy in Indian population. In the initial analysis, we observed that treatment group did not make any impact over the response. While subset of prostate cancer with large number of bony metastases has higher propensity to convert into hormone refractory cancer. Conclusions: Addition of flutamide did not provide benefit. We observed that large number of bony metastases had poor response to hormonal therapy, hence it requires large trial to substantiate this initial observation. Copyright  2011 Elsevier B.

We performed a systematic review of both adjuvant and neo-adjuvant hormone therapy combined with surgery or radiotherapy in localised or locally advanced prostate cancer. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this review was to undertake a systematic review and, if possible, a meta-analysis of neo-adjuvant and adjuvant hormone therapy in localised or locally advanced prostate cancer. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched MEDLINE (1966 to 2006), EMBASE, The Cochrane Library, Science Citation Index, LILACS, and SIGLE for relevant randomised trials. Handsearching of appropriate publications was also undertaken. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials of patients with localised or locally advanced prostate cancer, that is, stages T1 to T4, any N, M0, comparing neo-adjuvant or adjuvant hormonal deprivation in combination with primary therapy (radical radiotherapy or radical prostatectomy) versus primary therapy alone were included in this review. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data were extracted from eligible studies and assessed for quality, and included information on study design, participants, interventions, and outcomes. Comparable data were pooled together for meta-analysis with intention-to treat principle. MAIN RESULTS: Men with prostate cancer have different clinical outcomes based on their risk (T1 to T2, T3 to T4, PSA levels and Gleason score). However, the majority of studies included in this review did not report results by risk groups; therefore, it was not possible to perform sub-group analysis.Neo-adjuvant hormonal therapy prior to prostatectomy did not improve overall survival (OR 1.11, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.85, P = 0.69). However, there was a significant reduction in the positive surgical margin rate (OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.42, P < 0.00001) and a significant improvement in other pathological variables such as lymph node involvement, pathological staging and organ confined rates. There was a borderline significant reduction of disease recurrence rates (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.0, P = 0.05), in favour of treatment. The use of longer duration of neo-adjuvant hormones, that is either 6 or 8 months prior to prostatectomy, was associated with a significant reduction in positive surgical margins (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.80, P = 0.002).In one study, neo-adjuvant hormones prior to radiotherapy significantly improved overall survival for Gleason 2 to 6 patients; although, in two studies, there was no improvement in disease-specific survival (OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.32, P = 0.97). However, there was a significant improvement in both clinical disease-free survival (OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.93 to 2.40, P < 0.00001) and biochemical disease-free survival (OR 1.93, 95% CI 1.45 to 2.56, P < 0.00001).Adjuvant androgen deprivation following prostatectomy did not significantly improve overall survival at 5 years (OR 1.50, 95% CI 0.79 to 2.85, P = 0.2); although one study reported a significant disease-specific survival advantage with adjuvant therapy (P = 0.001). In addition, there was a significant improvement in disease-free survival at both 5 years (OR 3.73, 95%CI 2.30 to 6.03, P < 0.00001) and 10 years (OR 2.06, 95% CI 1.34 to 3.15, P = 0.0009).Adjuvant therapy following radiotherapy resulted in a significant overall survival gain apparent at 5 (OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.83, P = 0.0009) and 10 years (OR 1.44, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.84, P = 0.003); although there was significant heterogeneity (P = 0.09 and P = 0.07, respectively). There was also a significant improvement in disease-specific survival (OR 2.10, 95% CI 1.53 to 2.88, P = 0.00001) and disease-free survival (OR 2.53, 95% CI 2.05 to 3.12, P < 0.00001) at 5 years. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Hormone therapy combined with either prostatectomy or radiotherapy is associated with significant clinical benefits in patients with local or locally advanced prostate cancer. Significant local control may be achieved when given prior to prostatectomy or radiotherapy, which may improve patient's quality of life. When given adjuvant to these primary therapies, hormone therapy, not only provides a method for local control, but there is also evidence for a significant survival advantage. However, hormone therapy is associated with significant side effects, such as hot flushes and gynaecomastia, as well as cost implications. The decision to use hormone therapy should, therefore, be taken at a local level, between the patient, clinician and policy maker, taking into account the clinical benefits, toxicity and cost. More research is needed to guide the choice, the duration, and the schedule of hormonal deprivation therapy, and the impact of long-term hormone therapy with regard to toxicity and the patient's quality of life. NEO-ADJUVANT AND ADJUVANT HORMONE THERAPY FOR LOCALISED AND LOCALLY ADVANCED PROSTATE CANCER: The management of early prostate cancer is one of the most controversial areas in the field of cancer medicine with surgery, radiotherapy, primary hormonal therapy (achieved either by medication or by the surgical removal of the testes - orchidectomy) and watchful waiting, all being acceptable forms of initial treatment. Treatment decision making is often based on patient and provider preferences taking into account the risks and benefits of therapies and disease progression. Since prostate cancer is driven, in part by male sex hormones, the use of hormonal treatment to reduce the level of circulating male hormones is a potentially very useful method of treating all stages of this disease. Recently, research on the use of such hormonal therapy in combination with both surgery and radiotherapy has increased. This systematic review combines the results of all the important trials looking at the role of hormones in combination with surgery and radiotherapy for localised and locally advanced prostate cancer.The results of this review indicate that neo-adjuvant hormone therapy administered three to six months before the primary curative therapy (radical prostatectomy radical radiotherapy) did not, as yet, result in a detectable improvement in overall survival or disease-specific survival. There was, however, a significant improvement in disease-free survival (approximately 90%) when given before radiotherapy. Neo-adjuvant hormone therapy prior to radical prostatectomy also significantly improved pathological variables associated with poor prognosis, such as the positive surgical margin rate and the proportion of patients with positive lymph nodes. Adjuvant hormone therapy following prostatectomy did not change overall or disease-specific survival compared to prostatectomy alone. However, adjuvant therapy following radiotherapy significantly improved overall survival and disease-specific survival up to 10 years post-treatment. Disease-free survival was also significantly improved at 10 years. Hormone therapy is associated with a number of side effects including hot flushes and gynaecomastia. The decision to use these agents has to be made after a full discussion between the patient and the physician regarding the disease risk of the patient, the benefits from the use of additional hormones and the side effects of hormonal therapy","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Objectives: To study the efficacy and safety of pelvic and prostatic fossa radiation therapy following radical prostatectomy for adenocarcinoma. Methods: A retrospective review of the charts of 1,050 patients treated at the Sheba Medical Center for prostate cancer between 1990 and 2002 identified 48 patients who received post-prostatectomy pelvic and prostatic fossa radiotherapy for biochemical failure. Two patients were classified as T1, T2A-9, T2B-19, T3A-7 and T3B-11. Gleason score was 2-4 in 9 patients, 5-6 in 22 patients, 7 in 10 patients and 8-10 in 7 patients. Positive surgical margins were noted in 28 patients (58%) of whom 18 had single and 10 had multiple positive margins. Radiation was delivered with 6 mV photons using a four-field box to the pelvis followed by two lateral arcs to the prostatic fossa. Results: At a median follow-up of 34.3 months (25th, 75th) (14.7, 51.3) since radiation therapy, 32 patients (66%) are free of disease or biochemical failure. Exploratory analysis revealed that a pre-r adiation PSA less than 2 ng/ml was associated with a failure rate of 24% compared with 66% in patients with a pre-radiation PSA greater than 2 ng/ml (chi-square P < 0.006). Conclusions: For patients with biochemical failure following radical prostatectomy early salvage radiation therapy is an effective and safe treatment option","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Even with FDG PET, problems due to decreased avidity compared to other tumor types can occur. We assessed PET's ability to monitor changes in such tumors during an anti-angiogenic therapy. We measured changes in tumor blood flow (15O), blood volume (11CO), 18F-FDG uptake and 'metabolic volume' before and during thalidomide treatment, to see if these changes correlated with changes in PSA values.Six patients with androgen-independent prostate cancer were imaged with 18F-FDG, 11CO, and 15O water before and during (mean interval 63 days, range 55-76 days) thalidomide therapy (200-1200mg/day). Lesions were visually identified on FDG images (9 bone, 5 soft tissue lesions). VOI's were generated by 3D region growing, with a 50% maximum pixel threshold. These VOI's were registered with, and applied to, the 11CO and water studies. Correlations with PSA values were done using the Spearman rank test.The change in maximum (r = 0.77, p = 0.06) and mean FDG value (r = 0.83, p = 0.03), functional FDG volume (r = 0.66, p = 0.14), and 11-CO blood volume (r = 0.77, p = 0.06) all correlated with the change in PSA. Changes in blood flow values were smaller than the variance of the method for repeated measures, likely due to low flow values in bone.Changes in blood volume measured by 11CO, and the mean and peak activity and functional volume measured by 18F-FDG, correlate with changes in PSA and may be useful in monitoring anti-angiogenic therapy in prostate cancer","","","","","","S109503970000056X [pii]","National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA","PM:11150747","","","",""

There have been few reports of this therapy in an Asian male population. METHODS: Nine patients with progressive metastatic HRPC completed at least one cycle of combination therapy employing weekly paclitaxel plus estramustine. Paclitaxel was given weekly for 3 weeks as a 2-h intravenous infusion at a dose of 100 mg/infusion. The cycle was repeated every 4 weeks. A dose of 280 mg of oral estramustine was administrated twice daily for 21 days from the first day of each cycle. Both efficacy and toxicity were recorded. RESULTS: Grade 1 sensory neuropathy was seen in three patients (33%) and grade 4 thrombopenia/anemia was seen in one patient (11%). Performance status improved in three of seven patients (43%), while six patients (67%) showed a 50% or greater decline in prostate-specific antigen levels. Two of these patients experienced significant improvement in bone pain. One patient died of cardiac infarction during this trial and another died of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy subsequent to gastrointestinal bleeding. An additional patient suffered non-fatal pulmonary infarction. The one-year median survival rate was 22.2% and the overall survival period was 36 weeks. CONCLUSION: Although weekly paclitaxel plus estramustine may pose a significant risk, this combination may have a beneficial effect on the quality of life HRPC patients. A well-designed phase I-II trial in an Asian male population is highly recommended","","","","","","671 [pii]","Department of Urology, Kitasato University School of Medicine, Sagamihara, Kanagawa, Japan","PM:12941125","","","",""

Materials and Methods: We reviewed the progressive status and survival of 177 patients with stage C or D prostate cancer who had received hormone therapy at our institution. The overall survival rate, incidence of progression to hormone refractory prostate cancer and interval until progression were analyzed with reference to the nadir PSA level. Multiple regression analysis was used to analyze the predictive factors for progression to hormone refractory prostate cancer, and the relative efficacy of the nadir PSA level in predicting progression was evaluated by receiver operating characteristics analysis. Results: Median followup was 39 months (range 3 to 89) and 85.4% of patients (151) responded to treatment, of whom 77.5% (117) had progression to hormone refractory prostate cancer. Median time until nadir PSA levels were reached after hormone therapy was 8.1 months and median time until hormone refractory prostate cancer was 24.0 months. Nadir PSA levels were less than 0.2 ng./ml. in 31% of respondents, 0.2 to 1.0 ng./ml. in 23%, 1.1 to 10 ng./ml. in 42% and greater than 10 ng./ml. in 5%. These groups had similar clinicopathological characteristics. Nadir PSA levels correlated significantly with pretreatment PSA levels, Gleason scores and progression to hormone refractory prostate cancer (p = 0.01, p <0.01 and p <0.001, respectively), and inversely correlated with the interval to the establishment of hormone refractory prostate cancer (r = -0.465, p <0.05). By univariate analysis bone metastasis, nadir PSA, PSA at 6 months after treatment and pretreatment PSA were significantly associated with progression to hormone refractory prostate cancer. Only the nadir PSA was calculated to be an independent factor by multivariate analysis. Receiver operating characteristics analysis indicated that nadir PSA predicted progression to hormone refractory prostate cancer after 2 years with an accuracy of 86.2%. With the lower limit of the nadir PSA level set to 1.1 ng./ml., sensitivity was 80.3% and specificity was 83.8%, and these levels were deemed the most appropriate. Furthermore, nadir PSA after hormone therapy was an independent prognosticator for survival, as were initial levels of hemoglobin and alkaline phosphatase. Conclusions: The nadir PSA level after hormone therapy may be the most accurate factor predicting the progression to hormone refractory prostate cancer and is an independent prognostic factor for survival. Furthermore, a lower limit for the nadir PSA level of 1.1 ng./ml. gives optimal sensitivity and specificity","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: Whole-body PET followed by CT or in-line PET/CT using 3.3-4 MBq/kg of (18)F-choline was performed prospectively on 30 patients with prostate cancer, castrate testosterone levels, and rising post-treatment prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels. Lesions demonstrating increased (18)F-choline uptake were classified as measurable or non-measureable based on RECIST. RESULTS: Three patients were known previously to have RECIST measurable lesions, 10 patients had metastatic findings on radionuclide bone scan, and 17 patients had elevated serum PSA level as the only evidence of disease. Lesions demonstrating increased (18)F-choline uptake were found in 28 (93%) patients. Thirty-eight PET/CT lesions from 14 patients were measurable by RECIST. Lymph node maximum standardized uptake value (SUV(max)) correlated with lymph node diameter (Pearson r = 0.44, p < 0. 001). RECIST measurable lymph node SUV(max) was significantly higher than that of non-measurable nodes (8.1 vs. 3.7, p < 0.0001). Detection of skeletal, prostatic, or RECIST-compatible lesions was more likely with a PSA level greater than 4.0 ng/ml (Fisher exact p = 0.0005). CONCLUSION: Lesions detected with (18)F-choline PET/CT are frequently measurable by RECIST at baseline. Therefore, it may be feasible to include comparisons to RECIST in evaluations of (18)F-choline as a therapeutic response marker for hormone refractory prostate cancer","","","","","","10.1007/s12149-009-0273-1 [doi]","Hamamatsu/Queen's PET Imaging Center, Honolulu, HI 96813, USA. skwee@queens.org","PM:19529978","","","",""

Since prostate cancer grows insidiously without signs or symptoms until it reaches the bones-when cure has become an exception-screening is essential to diagnose the disease at an earlier stage when cure is possible in the majority of patients. At 7 years' median follow-up with continuous hormonal therapy, cancer-specific death was observed in less than 5% of patients with treatment started at the stage of clinically localized disease, compared to 70% to 90% when treatment is started in patients with bone metastases. With appropriate screening, 99% of prostate cancers can be diagnosed at the localized stage with no sign of bone metastases. Starting androgen blockade at time of diagnosis of localized disease can achieve long-term control of the disease in close to 100% of patients and even cure the disease in the majority of them, as evidenced by maintenance of undetectable PSA in 85% of patients after cessation of long-term combined hormonal therapy. The available data indicate that the use of regular PSA screening and immediate treatment can markedly reduce mortality rates among prostate cancer patients.

The discovery of medical castration with LHRH agonists has led to fundamental changes in the endocrine therapy of prostate cancer. In 1979, the first prostate cancer patient treated with an LHRH agonist received such treatment at the Laval University Medical Center. A long series of studies have clearly demonstrated that medical castration with an LHRH agonist has inhibitory effects on prostate cancer eq uivalent to those of surgical castration. The much higher acceptability of LHRH agonists has been essential to permit a series of studies in localized disease. Based upon the finding that the testicles and adrenals contribute approximately equal amounts of androgens in the human prostate, the combination of medical (LHRH agonist) or surgical castration associated with a pure antiandrogen (flutamide, nilutamide or bicalutamide) has led to the first demonstration of a prolongation of life in prostate cancer, namely a 10-20% decreased risk of death according to the various metaanalyses of all the studies performed in advanced disease. In analogy with the other types of advanced cancers, the success of combined androgen blockade in metastatic disease is limited by the development of resistance to treatment. To avoid the problem of resistance to treatment while taking advantage of the relative ease of diagnosis of prostate cancer at an 'early' stage, the much higher acceptability of LHRH agonists has permitted a series of studies which have demonstrated a major reduction in deaths from prostate cancer ranging from 31% to 87% at 5 years of follow-up in patients with localized or locally advanced prostate cancer.

The only means of preventing prostate cancer from migrating to the bones and becoming incurable is efficient treatment at the localized stage of the disease. In fact, since radical prostatectomy, radiotherapy and brachytherapy can achieve cure in about 50% of cases, these approaches are all equally valid choices as first treatment of localized prostate cancer. However, in view of the current knowledge and available data, nowadays, androgen blockade should also be considered as first line treatment. While showing the high efficacy of hormonal therapy in localized prostate cancer, present knowledge clearly indicate that long-term treatment with the best available hormonal drugs, somewhat similar to the 5 years of Tamoxifen in breast cancer, is required for optimal control of prostate cancer. It is also clear from the data analyzed that combined androgen blockage alone could well be an e fficient therapy of localized prostate cancer while it has already been recognized as the best therapy for metastatic disease. This paper presents and discusses the current knowledge available on the use and results of endocrine therapy in localized prostate cancer","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Patients with breast cancer and multiple myeloma who survive for 2 or more years after developing bone metastases/lesions are at chronic risk for skeletal complications. Patients with prostate cancer and other solid tumors are also at high risk for skeletal complications, and, until recently, no effective treatment had been identified. Zoledronic acid, a new-generation bisphosphonate, was recently shown to be safe and effective as treatment for the prevention of skeletal complications in three randomized, phase III trials involving more than 3000 patients with multiple myeloma, breast, prostate, and lung cancers, and other solid tumors. Zoledronic acid (4 mg) was at least as effective as pamidronate (90 mg) in preventing skeletal complications in the overall study population of patients with breast cancer and multiple myeloma and was superior to pamidronate in the subset of over 1000 patients with breast cancer. In patients with solid tumors, including prostate cancer and lung cancer, zoledronic acid significantly reduced the incidence and delayed the onset of skeletal complications compared with placebo. Zoledronic acid is the first bisphosphonate with broad clinical utility and may become the preferred bisphosphonate for the treatment of bone metastases in patients with advanced cancers","","","","","","S0093775403004500 [pii]","Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, East Hannover, NJ 07936-1080, USA","PM:14613036","","","",""

In addition to the initial clinical data such as serum prostate-specific antigen level, findings on digital rectal examination, and core biopsy Gleason score, several procedures and imaging modalities are available to further stage newly diagnosed prostate cancer. A substantial percentage of the cost of managing prostate cancer is directly related to staging evaluations. Often, staging evaluations are performed that have limited test performance characteristics, subject the patient to unnecessary morbidity, or simply do not provide additional useful clinical information. It is important that the physician be familiar with the indications for the available staging modalities as well as the test performance characteristics in order to proceed appropriately and in an economically judicious fashion. This paper reviews the literature on this topic and summarizes previous experiences with procedures and imaging modalities for staging newly diagnosed prostate cancer.

The objective of this study is to verify that the tendency occurs as well in Asian population, as well as to establish a possible correlation between PSA level, bone scan result, and Gleason score. Method: Records of 116 patients diagnosed to have CaP were reviewed retrospectively for bone scan results, PSA levels, and Gleason score. Result: Thirty-four patients were proven to have bone metastases based on positive bone scintigraphy result. None of these patients had a PSA level of less than 10 ng/ml. Two patients had PSA level between 11 and 20, and 15 patients had PSA level between 21 and 200. For patients with PSA level over 201, 17 had bone metastases on bone scintigraphy. Conclusion: Based on the PSA level, the likelihood of positive bone scintigraphy result can be postulated. According to PSA levels, staging investigations can be more selective for patients with confirmed CaP. The risk of having positive bone scan is so low that it is not required for patients with PSA level less than 10 ng/ml. On the other hand, on studying the correlation between Gleason score and PSA level or bone scan results, no statistically significant relationship was established.

It also possesses antiangiogenic activity through a direct apoptotic effect on endothelial cells. Other molecular mechanisms, including microtubule stabilization by inhibition of the colchicine-binding site, have been reported. The exact mechanism of action of 2-methoxyestradiol is still unclear, but it has been shown to be effective in preventing tumor growth in a variety of cell lines. 2-Methoxyestradiol also possesses cardioprotective activity by inhibiting vascular smooth muscle cell growth in arteries. It has a lower binding affinity for estrogen receptor alpha compared with that of estradiol, and its affinity for estrogen receptor beta is even lower than that of estrogen receptor alpha, thus it has minimal estrogenic activity. 2-Methoxyestradiol is distinct because of its inability to engage estrogen receptors as an agonist, and its unique antiproliferative and apoptotic activities are mediated independently of estrogen receptors alpha and beta. A phase I clinical trial of 2-methoxyestradiol 200, 400, 600, 800, and 1,000 mg/day in 15 patients with breast cancer showed significant reduction in bone pain and analgesic intake in some patients, with no significant adverse effects.

Efficacy may be improved by adding chemotherapy to the treatment regimen as a radiation sensitizer. The combination of (188)Re-HEDP and capecitabine (Xeloda(R)) was tested in a clinical phase I study. METHODS: Patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer were treated with capecitabine for 14 days (oral twice daily in a dose escalation regimen with steps of 1/3 of 2,500 mg/m(2) per day in cohorts of three to six patients, depending on toxicity). Two days later patients were treated with 37 MBq/kg (188)Re-HEDP as an intravenous injection. Six hours after treatment post-therapy scintigraphy was performed. Urine was collected for 8 h post-injection. Follow-up was at least 8 weeks. The primary end-point was to establish the maximum tolerable dose (MTD) of capecitabine when combined with (188)Re-HEDP. Secondary end-points included the effect of capecitabine on the biodistribution and pharmacokinetics of (188)Re-HEDP. RESULTS: Three patients were treated in the first and second cohorts, each without unacceptable toxicity. One of six patients in the highest cohort experienced unacceptable toxicity (grade 4 thrombopaenia). The MTD proved to be the maximum dose of 2,500 mg/m(2) per day capecitabine. No unexpected toxicity occurred. Capecitabine had no effect on uptake or excretion of (188)Re-HEDP. CONCLUSION: Capecitabine may be safely used in combination with (188)Re-HEDP in a dose of 2,500 mg/m(2) per day and 37 MBq/kg, respectively.

This debate continues as major studies investigating the value of population-based screening have yet to be concluded. Despite this, there is increasing evidence from preliminary reports from these series, as well as numerous others relating to outcome prediction for PC, that early detection leads to improved outcomes and a decrease in the burden of metastatic disease on our healthcare system. PC is rarely symptomatic until it has metastasised to bone and because of this PSA-based screening remains the only widely available and reliable method of diagnosis for organ-confined disease. There is now compelling evidence to show that: 1. Cancers diagnosed by screening are more likely to be early stage, when most can be cured by a number of different treatment options. 2. The maximum benefits of screening are for men aged 50-70 years. Older men have a greater chance of a clinically insignificant cancer being diagnosed for which treatment is not necessary. 3. The familial risks of PC are well recognised. In particular, men with one or more first-degree relatives already diagnosed with the disease should be actively encouraged to undergo screening. 4. Modern histopathological assessment of fine core needle biopsies of the prostate allows for the likely behaviour of cancer present to be accurately predicted. Changes that mimic those of malignancy can be confidently identified, so these cases are no longer incorrectly diagnosed. These improvements mean that now most men aged 50-70 years diagnosed with PC will have clinically significant cancers that require treatment","","","","","","785814697 [pii];10.1080/00313020701684458 [doi]","Department of Pathology and Molecular Medicine, Wellington School of Medicine and Health Sciences, and Department of Radiation Oncology, Wellington Hospital, New Zealand","PM:18027255","","","",""

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-three combined radiofrequency ablation and cementoplasty procedures were completed in 36 patients. Thirty-four vertebrae (20 lumbar, 14 thoracic), 14 acetabulae, 3 sacra, 1 pubic symphysis, and 1 humerus were treated. Patient age ranged from 34 to 81 years (mean 57.6 years, SD=12.6). Primary malignancies included: 12 breast, 5 lung, 6 multiple myeloma, 2 prostate, 2 renal cell carcinoma, 1 synovial sarcoma, 1 endometrial, 1 oral squamous cell carcinoma, 1 lymphoma, 1 colon, 1 transitional cell carcinoma, 1 colorectal, 1 cholangiocarcinoma, and 1 pheochromocytoma. Primary neoplasm location, pain levels pre- and post-procedure (as assessed using the Visual Analog Scale), number of radiofrequency (RF) treatments and any extravasation were documented. RESULTS: Combined radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and cementoplasty procedures were performed with 100% technical success (53 out of 53). The mean pre-procedure and post-procedure pain, as measured by the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), was 7.2/10 and 3.4/10 respectively. Symptomatic complications included one case of self-resolving transient thermal sciatic neurapraxia following RFA and acetabuloplasty. Two cases of transient pain following epidural leaks during treatment of thoracic vertebrae and breast metastases also occurred. Non-symptomatic complications, from a variety of cases, included cement emboli to the lung, incidental, non-symptomatic leaks into the needle track, spinal canal, draining veins, disc spaces, and an intra-articular leak into the hip joint.

Death receptor 4, encoded by the TNFRSF10A gene, is an important mediator of apoptosis and its dysfunction may be related to cancer development and distant tumor spread. A single nucleotide polymorphism in TNFRSF10A (Glu228Ala, rs20576) within a conserved region of the extracellular cysteine-rich domain of death receptor 4 has been associated with an increased risk for a variety of tumor entities. Aim of the present study was to evaluate the role of the TNFRSF10A polymorphism in metastatic progression of prostate cancer alter radiation therapy. METHODS. We carried out a prospective study including 702 prostate cancer patients from the Austrian PROCAGENE ( Prostate Cancer Genetics) study. Development of metastases was examined in regular follow-up investigations. TNFRSF10A genotypes were determined by a 5prime-nuclease assay (TaqMan). RESULTS. Within a median follow-up time of 10 months (range 0-60 months), 24 (3.4%) patients developed metastases. In a Cox regression model including age at diagnosis and risk group as potential confounders, carriage of an 228Ala allele was associated with a relative risk of 2.47 (95% Cl 1.10-5.54; P = 0.028) for metastases. TNFRSF10A genotypes were not associated with tumor stage, grade, risk group or age at diagnosis. CONCLUSION. We conclude that the TNFRSF10A Glu228Ala polymorphism may be a novel independent risk factor for prostate cancer metastases after radiation therapy.

We conducted a randomized phase II trial of two doses of BMS-275291 (1,200 versus 2,400 mg) in hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC) patients with bone metastases to probe for a dose-response relationship and to assess differential toxicities. Serial serum and urine specimens were collected to assess for markers of bone metabolism. METHODS: The primary end point was 4-month progression-free survival (PFS). Eligibility criteria included documentation of androgen-independent disease (including anti-androgen withdrawal), skeletal metastasis, adequate end-organ function and performance status, and no more than one prior chemotherapy regimen. Patients were randomized to 1,200 mg orally once daily (arm A) or 1,200 mg orally twice daily (arm B). Response was assessed every 56 days. RESULTS: Eighty patients were enrolled: 39 in arm A and 41 in arm B. There were no responders by prostate-specific antigen or measurable disease to treatment. Stable disease was noted at 8 weeks in 39% of patients in arm A and in 17% of patients in arm B. Progression of disease at 8 weeks was seen in 61% of patients in arm A versus 83% of patients in arm B. Median survival time was 21.6 months (95% confidence interval, 17.5; not reached), whereas median PFS time was 1.8 months (95% confidence interval 1.74; 2) for all patients. Patients in arm A had a median survival time that was not reached, whereas patients on arm B has a median survival time of 21 months (P = 0.2). PFS at 4 months favored arm A: 22% versus 10% (log-rank, P = 0.008). Grade 3 toxicities occurred in 5 (13%) patients in arm A and in 9 (22%) patients in arm B. Grade 4 toxicities were uncommon (only 4% of patients): one each of thrombosis, fatigue, and motor neuropathy was seen in the arm B. Bone marker studies showed that baseline serum levels of N-telopeptide, osteocalcin, procollagen I NH2-terminal propeptide, and PICP had prognostic significance for PFS and/or overall survival. CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of dose schedule, BMS-275291 was well tolerated in HRPC patients and had no dose-limiting arthritis. Toxicities differed modestly according to the dose schedule employed. As overall survival and PFS favored the once daily schedule, this dose schedule is recommended for future studies. Baseline markers of bone metabolism may have prognostic value in HRPC patients with bone metastases","","","","","","12/5/1556 [pii];10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-05-2074 [doi]","University of California Davis Cancer Center and the University of California Davis School of Medicine, Sacramento, California 95817, USA. primo.lara@ucdmc.ucdavis.edu","PM:16533781","","","",""

METHODS: Seven patients with progressive clinically metastatic prostate cancer underwent (18)F-FDG and (18)F-FDHT PET scans in addition to conventional imaging methods. Three patients had their studies repeated 1 mo later, 2 while on testosterone therapy, and the third after treatment with 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG). High-pressure liquid radiochromatography was used to separate (18)F-FDHT from radiolabeled metabolites. Lesion-by-lesion comparisons between the (18)F-FDHT, (18)F-FDG, and conventional imaging methods were performed. RESULTS: Metabolism of (18)F-FDHT was rapid, with 80% conversion within 10 min to radiolabeled metabolites that circulated bound to plasma proteins. Tumor uptake was rapid and tumor retention was prolonged. Fifty-nine lesions were identified by conventional imaging methods. (18)F-FDG PET was positive in 57 of 59 lesions (97%), with an average lesion maximum standardized uptake value (SUV(max)) = 5.22. (18)F-FDHT PET was positive in 46 of 59 lesions (78%), with the average positive lesion SUV(max) = 5.28. Treatment with testosterone resulted in diminished (18)F-FDHT uptake at the tumor site. CONCLUSION: (18)F-FDHT localizes to tumor sites in patients with progressive clinically metastatic prostate cancer and may be a promising agent to analyze antigen receptors and their impact on the clinical management of prostate cancer","","","","","","","Department of Radiology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10021, USA. larsons@mskcc.org","PM:15001675","","","",""

In prostate cancer, they are anticipated to be released into the blood circulation where they may be immunogenic. The aim of our study was to examine whether prostasome antibody presence in serum bears any prognostic significance for men with prostate cancer. We developed a sensitive and specific immunoassay (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) to establish the presence of antiprostasome antibodies in serum. The antiprostasome antibody titer in serum, sampled before any kind of therapy for prostate cancer, was examined together with clinicopat hologic variables and outcome over a median follow-up of 350 days in 218 patients with verified prostate cancer. We detected these antibodies in 191 (88%) of these patients. This antibody titer did not correlate to serum values of prostate-specific antigen. Significant, inverse relationships were registered for antiprostasome antibody titer, and metastases to bone and/or lymph nodes (P = 0.035) and pT (P = 0.025). These results indicate that the antiprostasome antibody titer in serum may be a novel marker for prostate cancer liability to metastasize. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

ET-1, acting primarily through the endothelin A receptor (ET(A)), is integrally involved in multiple facets of prostate cancer progression, including cell growth, inhibition of apoptosis, angiogenesis, development and progression of bone metastases, and mediation of pain responses. Clinical trials with the ET(A) antagonist, atrasentan, have demonstrated good tolerability, with the most common adverse events being headache, rhinitis, and peripheral edema. These trials have demonstrated statistically significant improvements in pain measures, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) kinetics, biologic markers of bone changes, and development of bone metastases. There have also been consistent improvements in time to progression, although not always statistically significant. Ongoing studies in a variety of patient populations will better define the role of ET receptor antagonists in the treatment of men with prostate cancer. In this article, we review the biology and pathophysiology of the ET axis in prostate cancer, critically analyze the major clinical trials reported to date, and discuss some emerging data and how it may impact the way we proceed in the future with the development of this class of drugs in prostate cancer","","","","","","","Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD 21231, USA","PM:14571415","","","",""

The burden of disease from bone metastasis has repercussions in terms of cost to society, decreased quality of life, and decreased survival. Given the magnitude of bone-related morbidity in advanced prostate cancer, physicians need to be aware of preventive and therapeutic measures, and to be proactive in implementing them. RECENT FINDINGS: Patients with prostate cancer are often osteopenic at baseline. Implementing androgen-deprivation therapy further increases bone mineral density loss. Lifestyle changes, vitamin D and calcium supplementation may slow the rate of bone mineral density loss. Bisphosphonates reduce androgen-deprivation therapy-related bone loss in prostate cancer patients. Zoledronic acid is the only bisphosphonate proven to decrease skeletal-related events in a randomized controlled trial in patients with metastatic prostate cancer. Newer agents such as selective oestrogen receptor modifiers and antibodies targeting receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand are under investigation. SUMMARY: Bone mineral density loss and skeletal complications are directly related to androgen-deprivation therapy and metastases in prostate cancer patients. Preventive and therapeutic modalities are available to physicians, who should be proactive in implementing them. Novel agents are under investigation and data pertaining to their efficacy should become available in the near future","","","","","","10.1097/SPC.0b013e3282f0c74f [doi];01263393-200710000-00007 [pii]","Urologic-Oncology Division, Centre Hospitalier de l'Universite de Montreal, Canada","PM:18685362","","","",""

Those under androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) face, however, the danger of increased bone complications that may arise due to compromised bone integrity. Such complications include fractures due to accelerated bone resorption and pathologic fractures due to the metastases that often occur with cancer progression. We herein discuss available strategies to avoid bone loss in this patient population. RECENT FINDINGS: Present recommendations to counter the effects of ADT on bone integrity include calcium and vitamin D supplementation. Bisphosphonates are helpful in reducing bone resorption and improving bone mineral density. New agents such as denosumab (a monoclonal antibody against RANK ligand) and selective estrogen receptor modulators seem to hold promise with respect to fracture risk reduction in patients on ADT.

The use of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is the mainstay of treatment for metastatic disease. The use of ADT has been reported to increase the risk of osteoporosis in men with prostate cancer, with higher risk of fracture than age matched controls. We sought to confirm the higher fracture risk of men with prostate cancer on ADT in the Canadian population. METHODS: We used the Population Health Research Data Repository housed at Manitoba Centre for Health Policy to identify all cases of fractures of the hip, vertebra, or wrist in men aged 50 years and older occurring between 1996 and 2004. Each case was matched with up to three controls by age, sex, ethnicity and medical comorbidity. We calculated the odds ratios (OR) for fracture with prostate cancer, and with or without ADT, after adjusting for possible confounding variables. RESULTS: There were 4696 cases of fracture matched with 14080 controls. After controlling for confounding variables, there was no significant association between prostate cancer and fracture risk (adjusted OR = 0.97, 95% confidence intervals [CI]: 0.83-1.15). We detected a significant association between ADT and fracture risk in men. The adjusted ORs for current and past ADT usage were 1.71 (95% CI: 1.13 - 2.58) and 2.42 (95% CI: 1.42-4.12) respectively. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that prostate cancer itself does not increase the risk of fracture and corroborate published results demonstrating an association between ADT and fractures","","","","","","","Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, CancerCare Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada","PM:20003666","","","",""

Bone scintigraphy was the premier modality to have an extensive role in the staging of prostate cancer and has remained an integral tool for over three decades in the assessment of newly diagnosed disease or in follow-up staging. Therapeutic treatment and palliation of disseminated disease, particularly in the skeleton, has also been successful with several radioisotopes including strontium-89 chloride. Despite advances in nuclear medicine techniques and molecular imaging technology such as positron emission tomography and radioimmunoscintigraphy, bone scintigraphy still remains the gold standard in the assessment of osseous metastatic disease in prostate cancer. Thus, it is important to continually review the modalities that have remained important over time and not just to focus on newer technologies.

Patients and Methods: Sixty-six consecutive patients with high-risk PCa prospectively underwent MRIas in addition to the standard sequential work-up (SW) of bone metastases (technetium-99m bone scintigraphy [BS] completed with targeted x-rays [TXR] in patients with equivocal BS findings and with MRI obtained on request [MRIor] in patients with inconclusive BS/TXR findings). Panel review of initial and 6-month follow-up MRI findings, BS/TXR, and all available baseline and follow-up clinical and biologic data were used as the best valuable comparator to define metastatic status. Diagnost ic effectiveness of MRIas alone was compared with each step of the SW. Impact of MRIas screening on patient management and costs was evaluated. Results: On the basis of the best valuable comparator, 41 patients (62%) had bone metastases. Sensitivities were 46% for BS alone, 63% for BS/TXR, 83% for BS/TXR/MRIor, and 100% for MRIas; the corresponding specificities were 32%, 64%, 100%, and 88%, respectively. MRIas was significantly more sensitive than any other approach (P < .05, McNemar). MRIas identified metastases in seven (30%) of 23 patients considered negative and eight (47%) of 17 patie nts considered equivocal by other strategies, which altered the initially planned therapy. Economic impact was variable among countries, depending on reimbursement rates. Conclusion: MRIas is more sensitive than the current SW of radiographically identified bone metastases in high-risk PCa patients, which impacts the clinical management of a significant proportion of patients.

GnRH- agonist-induced hypogonadism increases bone turnover and bone loss in men, but the mechanism underlying these changes is unknown. To determine whether gonadal steroid deprivation increases the skeletal sensitivity to PTH or blunts the ability of PTH to promote 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D formation, we infused human PTH-(1-34) at a dose of 0.55 U/kg.h for 24 h, in 11 men (ages, 50-82 yr) with locally advanced, node-positive, or biochemically recurrent prostate cancer but no evidence of bone metastases. PTH infusions were performed before initiation of GnRH agonist therapy (leuprolide acetate, 22.5 mg im, every 3 months) and again after 6 months of confirmed GnRH agonist-induced hypogonadism. Serum osteocalcin (OC), bone- specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), N-telopeptide (NTX), whole-blood ionized calcium, and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D were measured at baseline and every 6 h during each PTH infusion. Urinary NTX and free deoxypyridinoline (DPD) were assessed on spot morning samples before PTH infusion and on 24-h samples collected during the PTH infusions. Sex steroid levels were lowered to the castrate range in all subjects. Baseline serum NTX levels (drawn before PTH infusion) increased from 9.1 +/- 3.7 before leuprolide therapy to 13.9 +/- 5.0 nmol bone collagen equivalents (BCE)/L after leuprolide therapy (P = 0.003). Spot urine NTX collected before PTH infusion increased from 28 +/- 8 before leuprolide therapy to 49 +/- 17 nmol BCE/mmol creatinine after leuprolide therapy (P < 0.001), and urinary DPD increased from 4.7 +/- 1.1 to 7.4 +/- 1.8 nmol BCE/mmol creatinine (P < 0.001). Baseline serum OC and BSAP levels drawn before each PTH infusion did not change before vs. after leuprolide therapy. Serum NTX levels increased significantly during PTH infusion pre-GnRH agonist therapy (P < 0.001), and the rate of increase was greater after 6 months of GnRH agonist-induced hypogonadism (P < 0.01 for the difference in rates of change before and after GnRH agonist administration). Serum OC and BSAP levels decreased during PTH infusion (P < 0.001 for OC and P = 0.002 for BSAP), but the rates of decrease did not differ before or after leuprolide therapy (P = 0.45 for OC and P: = 0.19 for BSAP). Whole-blood ionized calcium levels increased during PTH infusion (P < 0.001), and the rate of increase was greater after GnRH agonist-induced hypogonadism (P = 0.068). Serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels increased in response to PTH infusion before leuprolide therapy (P = 0.022), but there was no difference in the rate of increase before or after leuprolide therapy (P = 0.66). The incremental increase in urinary NTX excretion, but not DPD, during PTH infusion was greater after 6 months of leuprolide therapy (P = 0.029 for NTX, P = 0.578 for DPD). We conclude that suppression of sex steroids in elderly men increases the skeletal responsiveness to the bone resorbing effects of PTH infusion but does not affect the response of bone formation markers or 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D to PTH. Changes in skeletal sensitivity to PTH may play an important role in the pathogenesis of hypogonadal bone loss in men","","","","","","","Endocrine Unit, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts 02114, USA. bleder@partners.org","PM:11158001","","","",""

Despite the osteoblastic appearance of bone metastases on imaging studies, patients with bone metastases have elevated markers of bone resorption, indicative of high osteoclast activity. Indeed, increased osteoclast activity is independently associated with higher risk of subsequent skeletal complications. Therapies aimed at reducing osteoclast activity would theoretically diminish disease-related skeletal complications, bone metastases and treatment-related fractures. Phase III clinical trials to address the role of osteoclast-targeted therapy in metastatic prostate cancer are reviewed here. Zoledronic acid, a potent bisphosphonate, significantly decreased the risk of skeletal complications in men with androgen-independent prostate cancer and bone metastases. Ongoing studies will evaluate the use of bisphosphonates or denosumab, a monoclonal antibody that inhibits the receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand signaling in the prevention of bone metastases or skeletal complications. Additional studies are needed to determine the optimal timing, schedule and duration of bisphosphonate treatment in men with bone metastases. The results of these trials in the near future may herald further evolution in the targeting of osteoclasts and optimal supportive care in men with prostate cancer.

Fifty patients were with and 27 patients without objective evidence of metastatic bone progression during the administration of zoledronic acid. RESULTS: The baseline bone marker concentrations were not significantly different between the groups. After administration of zoledronic acid all bone markers except of ICTP decreased compared with baseline. CTx showed the greatest decrease. In patients with metastatic bone progression PINP, tALP, bALP, and ICTP were significantly higher at weeks 24, 36, 48, and 60 after starting treatment with zoledronic acid compared with patients without progression. In addition to the information of prostate-specific antigen as a monitoring parameter, the bone formation marker showed a better distinction between patients with and without disease progression.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of these markers in prostate cancer patients with bone metastases before and during the treatment with zoledronic acid as predictive and monitoring tools of skeletal-related events (SRE). METHODS: One hundred seventeen prostate cancer patients with bone metastases and treated with zoledronic acid (4 mg every 4 weeks) were examined. Fifty-six patients were with and 61 patients without SRE during a 60-week study. Total and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, and amino-terminal procollagen propeptides of type-I-collagen (PINP), cross-linked N-terminal (NTx), cross-linked C-terminal telopeptides of type-I-collagen (ICTP), and C-terminal telopeptides of type-I-collagen as well as prostate-specific antigen (PSA) were measured before and 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 weeks after starting treatment. RESULTS: Higher baseline concentrations were observed in the SRE group. The bone markers except for ICTP and tALP decreased to 20-80% of the baseline values at week 12 after the drug administration showing a generally higher decline in the non-SRE group except for NTx. At all time points during treatment higher and increasing concentrations of bone markers were observed in the SRE group compared with non-SRE group. Cox regression models with clinical data and bone markers showed the baseline NTx concentration as predictor of SREs. During the study, percentage changes of PINP and ICTP were most indicative for SREs. CONCLUSIONS: Bone markers are useful tools to predict and diagnose SRE in prostate cancer patients with bone metastases under receiving zoledronic acid therapy","","","","","","10.1002/pros.20917 [doi]","Department of Urology, Charite Hospital Berlin, University Medicine Berlin, Berlin, Germany","PM:19143027","","","",""

Standard treatment options are limited. Objective: To review the concepts and rationale behind targeted agents currently in late-stage clinical testing for patients with CRPC. Methods: Novel targeted therapies in clinical trials were identified from registries. The Medline database was searched for all relevant reports published from 1996 to October 2009. Bibliographies of the retrieved articles and major international meeting abstracts were hand-searched to identify additional studies. Results: Advances in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying prostate cancer (PCa) progression have translated into a variety of treatment approaches. Agents targeting androgen receptor activation and local steroidogenesis, angiogenesis, immunotherapy, apoptosis, chaperone proteins, the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) pathway, RANK ligand, endothelin receptors, and the Src family kinases are entering or have recently completed accrual to phase III trials for patients with CRPC. Conclusions: There has been an increase in the understanding of the mechanisms of progression of CRPC. A number of new agents targeting mechanisms of PCa progression with early promising results are in clinical trials and have the potential to provide novel treatment options for CRPC in the near fut ure.

However, the incidence of prostate cancer is much lower in dogs and the precise cell of origin is not known. Dogs with prostate cancer usually present with advanced disease that does not respond to androgen deprivation therapy. Similar to humans, affected dogs often develop osteoblastic bone metastases in the pelvis and/or lumbar spine with associated pain and neurological deficits. Other clinical signs include weight loss, lethargy, and abnormal urination and/or defecation. Surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation have been used to treat dogs with prostate cancer, but success has been limited by the location and aggressive nature of the disease. It is evident that better methods of early detection and more effective therapies are needed for prostate cancer in dogs and advanced prostate carcinoma in men. Dogs with naturally-occurring prostate cancer are relevant models for the disease in humans and pre-clinical studies of new diagnostics and therapies in dogs may benefit both humans and dogs with prostate cancer.

The evaluation of its extension towards the skeleton is based on the bone scan, which has a better sensitivity than radiological examinations and clinical evaluation. Bone scan evaluation of the osseous extension, allowed a better comprehension of the mechanism of dissemination, the assumption of Batson appearing currently not very plausible. The importance of the osseous extension on the bone scan has a prognostic value; it constitutes one of the significant parameters of stratification in clinical trials. The indications of bone scan have been greatly modified since the introduction of prostate-specific antigen (PSA). At the initial assessment, the of bone scan should be indicated only if the rate of PSA exceeds 10-20 ng/mL, in the event of low grade tumor and pain. In the follow-up, the evolution of the PSA constitutes the major element of monitoring. After radical therapy, a rise in the PSA indicates bone scan, particularly if the level exceeds 10 ng/mL. In stage D2, routine bone scan is no longer indicated, except in phases II and III of the clinical trials.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Proteinase levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in the plasma of 30 patients with painful bone metastases from breast or prostate cancer undergoing multiple treatment with ZA (4 mg i.v., every 4 weeks). Healthy subjects (HS) of both genders (12 female and 30 male) served as the control group. The symptomatic response to ZA was assessed by the visual analog scale score (VAS). RESULTS: The median MMP-2 and MMP-9 pretreatment levels were more elevated in BMTS as compared to HS (p < or = 0.0001). Conversely, uPA levels were lower in BMTS p = 0.0033; no significant difference was observed for Cath B. ZA administration was associated with a symptomatic response (VAS score < or =4) in 25/30patients (83.3%) (p < 0.0001). This phenomenon paralleled a decrease of Cath B and MMP-2 plasma concentrations from baseline values on week 12 (p = 0.05). A similar trend, although not statistically significant, was also noted for MMP-9 and uPA. However, no direct relationship was observed between the analgesic effect induced by ZA and changes in the circulating levels of these enzymes. CONCLUSION: These data show that ZA administration may provide relief from bone pain in patients with diffuse skeletal metastases and confirm a possible implication of cysteine proteinases and matrix metalloproteinases in bone metastasis formation, but not in the pathogenesis of metastatic bone pain","","","","","","","Laboratory of Experimental Chemotherapy and Tumor Markers, Policlinico Universitario P.

OBJECTIVE: The goal of this article was to describe the pharmacologic properties of zoledronic acid (zoledronate) and discuss findings from preclinical and clinical studies of its use in skeletal disorders. METHODS: Relevant English-language literature was identified using the terms zoledronic acid, zoledronate, Zometa, and 118072-93-8 through searches of MEDLINE (1966-June 2003) and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-June 2003), and abstract proceedings from the American Society of Clinical Oncology (1997-2002). RESULTS: Zoledronic acid is a nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate that inhibits bone resorption. It is indicated for the treatment of hypercalcemia of malignancy and for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma or documented metastasis from solid tumors, in conjunction with standard antineoplastic therapy. The recommended dosage is 4 mg via IV over >or= 15 minutes every 3 or 4 weeks. Compared with pamidronate 90 mg, zoledronic acid 4 and 8 mg provided a higher complete response rate for hypercalcemia of malignancy by day 10 (88.4% and 86.7% vs 69.7%; P = 0.002 and P = 0.015) and longer duration of action (median time to relapse, 30 and 40 days vs 17 days; P = 0.001 and P = 0.007). In patients with breast cancer or multiple myeloma, zoledronic acid was as effective as pamidronate in delaying time to a first skeletal-related event (373 days vs 363 days). In patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer and bone metastases, zoledronic acid 4 mg reduced the proportion of patients who experienced a skeletal-related event (33% vs 44% with placebo; P = 0.021) or a skeletal fracture (13% vs 22% with placebo; P = 0.015). In patients with bone metastases from solid tumors, zoledronic acid delayed the median time to a first skeletal-related event (230 days vs 163 days with placebo; P = 0.023). Common adverse events include fever, nausea, constipation, fatigue, and bone pain. CONCLUSION: Zoledronic acid is an effective and generally well-tolerated treatment for hypercalcemia of malignancy and skeletal complications of metastatic bone disease","","","","","","S0149291803803272 [pii]","Philadelphia College of Pharmacy, University of the Sciences in Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA","PM:14693298","","","",""

Several meta-analyses and systematic reviews of trials comparing the efficacy of single vs multiple fractionated radiotherapy schedules noted that it is difficult to reach a consensus when inconsistent response end point definitions are used. The purpose of this study was to determine when the most appropriate time to evaluate a response is. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with symptomatic bone metastases treated with palliative radiotherapy between May 2003 and June 2005 were enrolled in the study. They were assessed with the Brief Pain Inventory at baseline, 1, 2 and 3 months after radiotherapy. Analgesic consumption during the preceding 24h was recorded and converted into an equivalent total daily dose of oral morphine. The response to radiotherapy was assessed using the International Bone Metastases Consensus end point definitions at 1, 2 and 3 months of follow-up. RESULTS: One hundred and ninety-nine patients were treated with palliative radiotherapy. All pain scores and functional interference items improved after radiotherapy. The proportion of evaluable patients with a complete response or a partial response increased between 1 month (58%) and 3 months of follow-up (67%). However, when considering intention-to-treat percentages, which take attrition into consideration, overall response rates dropped from 35% at 1 month, to 32% at 2 months, and finally 24% at 3 months. CONCLUSION: We conclude that 2 months after radiotherapy is the most appropriate time point to measure response rates for two reasons: (i) the maximum pain relief for some patients may take more than 4 weeks to achieve and (ii) attrition poses a major problem when response rates are measured at a later date. Future trials should use standardised criteria for end points to facilitate comparison and analysis across clinical trials. Given the limitations of this study, however, further investigations are needed to confirm the response time points for palliative cancer patients","","","","","","S0936-6555(07)00829-1 [pii];10.1016/j.clon.2007.09.009 [doi]","Rapid Response Radiotherapy Program, Odette Cancer Centre, University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada","PM:17981445","","","",""

In this study, the therapeutic efficacy of Re-188 HEDP was investigated in an uncontrolled initial trial of 61 patients with different types of advanced cancer for the palliation of painful bone metastases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-one patients with painful bone metastases of lung, prostate, breast, renal, rhinopharyngeal, and bladder cancers were treated with 1.1 GBq (31 mCi) to 6.9 GBq (188 mCi) Re-188 HEDP. After treatment, the patients were followed at weekly intervals for the first 2 months and monthly thereafter for as long as 1 year. Hematologic function tests were also performed before and after treatment for 6 weeks. Pain responses were scored according to a three-point pain-rating scale as complete, significant, and minimal. RESULTS: Prompt and significant relief of bone pain occurred in 80% of patients overall. Of the specific tumor types, pain relief was achieved in 77% of patients with lung cancer, in 80% with prostate cancer, in 83% with breast cancer, in 100% with bladder cancer, in 50% with renal cancer, in 50% with rhinopharyngeal cancer, and in 87% of patients with other tumor types, with no severe side effects or hematopoietic toxicity.

Despite significant advances in surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy to treat CaP, many patients unfortunately succumb to secondary disease (metastases). The invasive ability of tumour cells plays a key role in CaP metastasis and is a major cause of treatment failure. Urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) and its receptor (uPAR)-mediated signalling have been implicated in tumour cell invasion, survival, and metastasis in a variety of cancers including CaP. Both uPA and uPAR are expressed at much higher levels in CaP tissues than in benign and normal prostate tissues. They are used as diagnostic markers as well as therapeutic targets due to their aberrant and unique expression pattern during cancer progression. Current therapeutic options for patients with metastatic hormone-refractory CaP (HRPC) are very limited. Therefore, much effort is currently being directed toward targeting aberrant uPA or uPAR activity in CaP.

There is currently no cure for metastatic castrate-resistant CaP, and median survival for these patients is about 18 months; the high mortality rate seen is associated with widespread metastases. Progression of CaP from primary to metastatic disease is associated with several molecular and genetic changes that can affect the expression of specific tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) or receptors on the cell surface. Targeting TAAs is emerging as an area of promise for controlling late-stage and recurrent CaP. Several reviews have summarized the progress made in targeting signaling pathways for CaP but will not be discussed here. We describe some important CaP TAAs. These include prostate stem-cell antigen, prostate-specific membrane antigen, MUC1, epidermal growth factor receptor, platelet-derived growth factor and its receptor, urokinase plasminogen activator and its receptor, and extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer. We summarize recent advancements in our understanding of their role in CaP metastasis, as well as potential therapeutic options for targeting CaP TAAs. We also discuss the origin, identification, and characterization of prostate cancer stem cells (CSCs) and the potential benefits of targeting prostate CSCs to overcome chemoresistance and CaP recurrence.

PSA now routinely guides health care providers for the clinical management of PC over a wide range of clinical risk states for men at risk of PC, after local definitive therapy and after systemic therapy to prevent progression to metastatic bone disease, and to palliate men with hormone refractory prostate cancer (HRPC). To further assess the evidence that supports these clinical applications, this commentary reviews and critically evaluates the emerging body of new data focusing on several recently published seminal articles by D'Amico et al and Thompson et al, the new National Comprehensive Cancer Network 2004 recommendations for starting PSA testing at the age of 40 years old, the latest results from 2 phase 3 randomized, controlled trials of taxane-based regimens showing improved survival for men with HRPC, and the recent US FDA Public Workshop on Clinical Trial Endpoints in Prostate Cancer that helped to distill and synthesize the current state of the art and the progress toward validation of PSA metrics (eg, PSA velocity) as a surrogate end point (SE) for treatment efficacy with taxane-based regimens. Furthermore, several randomized, controlled chemoprevention trials in progress evaluating agents such as selenium and vitamin E in high-risk cohorts are well poised to confirm the validity of PSA as an SE for clinical efficacy for the prevention and progression of PC. Although there continues to be a need to validate better biomarkers before diagnosis of PC (more sensitive and specific) and after diagnosis to discern between indolent and aggressive forms of PC, it is very likely that some metric of PSA as a biomarker alone or as part of a panel of other serum proteomic markers or tissue-derived multiplex gene expression arrays will be around for years to come as a useful tool for risk stratification, early detection, prognosis, prediction, and as an SE of efficacy for prevention and treatment of PC","","","","","","00045391-200411000-00014 [pii]","Division of Cancer Prevention, National Cancer Institute, Rockville, Maryland, USA.

RESULTS: 81 of pts. after Re-188, 77% after Re-186 and 80% after Sr-89 reported relief of pain. The Karnofsky-Index established by pts. increased from 74 +/- 9% to 85 +/- 11% after Re-188, from 70 +/- 11% to 76 +/- 11% after Re-186 and from 62 +/- 10% to 69 +/- 10% after Sr-89.

We investigated the effect of (188)Re-HEDP on pain relief, analgesic intake and impairment of bone marrow function in 27 patients with bone metastases induced from prostate cancer. All patients were interviewed using a standardised set of questions before, and after therapy for 12 weeks. The patients were treated with 2700-3459 MBq of (188)Re-HEDP. Blood samples were taken weekly for 12 weeks, and a blood count was performed. Patients described an improvement on the Karnofsky performance scale from 74+/-7 to 85+/-9% 12 weeks after therapy (P=0.001). The pain score showed a maximum decrease from 44+/-18 to 27+/-20% in the third to the eight week after therapy (P=0.009). Seventy-six percent of the patients described a pain relief without increase of analgesic intake. Twenty percent of the patients could discontinue their analgesics and were pain free. Mean platelet count decreased from (286+/-75)*10(3) microl(-1) to (215+/-92)*10(3) microl(-1), and mean leucocyte count from (7.7+/-1.5)*10(3) microl(-1) to (6.0+/-1.9)*10(3) microl(-1) in the second to the fourth week after therapy.

However, the kinetic and radiation-absorbed doses have not been well documented. Therefore, the aim of this study was to gather dosimetric data for (188)Re-HEDP. METHODS: Thirteen prostate cancer patients with skeletal involvement were treated with 2,700-3,459 MBq (mean dose, 3,120 MBq) (188)Re-HEDP. Patients underwent whole-body scans 3, 20, and 28 h after therapy. The effective half-life, residence time, and radiation-absorbed dose values were calculated for the whole body, bone marrow, kidneys, and bladder as well as for 29 bone metastases. The urinary excretion rate was determined in 6 urine samples of each patient collected over 48 h at 8-h intervals beginning immediately after the administration of (188)Re-HEDP. After injection of (188)Re-HEDP, blood samples were taken weekly for 6 wk, and platelet and leukocyte counts were performed. RESULTS: The mean effective half-life was 15.9 +/- 3.5 h in bone metastases, 10.9 +/- 2.1 h in the bone marrow, 11.6 +/- 2.1 h in the whole body, 12.7 +/- 2.2 h in the kidneys, and 7.7 +/- 3.4 h in the bladder. The following radiation-absorbed doses were calculated: 3.83 +/- 2.01 mGy/MBq for bone metastases, 0.61 +/- 0.21 mGy/MBq for the bone marrow, 0.07 +/- 0.02 mGy/MBq for the whole body, 0.71 +/- 0.22 mGy/MBq for the kidneys, and 0.99 +/- 0.18 mGy/MBq for the bladder. (188)Re-HEDP showed a rapid urinary excretion within the first 8 h after therapy, with 41% of the (188)Re-HEDP administered being excreted. Forty-eight hours after therapy, the excretion rate was 60% +/- 12%. Only 1 patient showed a decrease of platelet count below 100 x 10(9) counts/L. None of the patients presented with a decrease of leukocyte count below 3.0 x 10(9) counts/L.

The resulting bone pain interferes with quality of life and thus requires effective treatment. However, various non-radiotherapeutic modalities such as analgesics, hormone therapy, orchidectomy, cytostatic and cytotoxic drugs, bisphosphonates and surgery are not universally effective. External-beam radiotherapy is suitable only for well-defined localized bone metastases, and extended field radiation is often accompanied by serious side effects. Therefore, systemic radionuclide therapy must be considered as a valuable and effective method of treatment in patients with widespread skeletal metastases. The alpha-emitter 223Ra-based Alpharadin is a new radiopharmaceutical under development by Algeta ASA in collaboration with Bayer Schering Pharma AG. Early clinical data demonstrated a significant decrease in bone-alkaline phosphatase levels following therapy with Alpharadin compared with placebo. Median time to PSA progression, median survival and pain relief were also superior to placebo, and no dose-limiting hematological toxicity was observed. A phase III trial for Alpharadin was ongoing at the time of publication","","","","","","","Hospital Kassel, Department of Nuclear Medicine, Monchebergstrasse, 41-43, 34125 Kassel, Germany. knut.liepe@klinikum-kassel.de","PM:19943206","","","",""

BM and PB samples were obtained from 66 newly diagnosed patients with T1-4pN0M0 prostate cancer. All samples were analyzed by standardized immunocytochemical methods (anticytokeratin mononuclear antibody; AE1/AE3) applying a negative immunomagnetic cell enrichment technique. A second sampling was obtained in 60 of the 66 patients >or=2 years after definitive radiotherapy. The median follow-up after high-dose radiotherapy of the patients was 65 months. For the analysis of the postradiotherapy clinical progression-free survival (PFS) treatment, failure was defined as pelvic tumor growth or development of distant metastases. At diagnosis CK+ cells were found in BM in 14 of 66 (21%) prostate cancer patients. This was not associated with an increased risk of progression. On the other hand, the presence of CK+ cells in 12 of 60 (20%) patients at the second BM aspiration was significantly related to a shorterPFS (p = 0.02). In the multivariate analysis, the presence of CK+ cells in the posttreatment BM did not remain as an independent variable of PFS assessment if posttreatment PSA was entered into the analysis. CK+ cells in PB were found in 12% of the patients. After therapy, none of the patients had detectable CK+ cells in PB. The presence of CK+ cells in the posttreatment but not in the pretreatment BM was associated with decreased PFS in patients irradiated for pelvis-confined nonmetastatic prostate cancer. Although this association was not retained in multivariate analysis, our observations indicate that the presence of CK+ cells after local therapy define a group of patients that have a high risk of developing distant metastases","","","","","","10.1002/ijc.10780 [doi]","Department of Oncology/Radiotherapy, The Norwegian Radium Hospital, University of Oslo, Montebello, Oslo, Norway.

The effective treatment of bone metastasis requires cooperation between medical, surgical and radiation oncologists. Radiotherapy, either in the form of targeted external beam radiation therapy, or systemic administration of radionuclides, plays a central role in treatment of symptomatic bone metastases. The appropriate external beam treatment techniques, dose and fractionation regimens for the treatment of symptomatic, localized bone metastasis have been established in prospective clinical trials. Large-field, hemi-body irradiation has been utilized for treatment of symptoms related to more widely disseminated bone metastases, but has been associated with substantial toxicity. Strontium-89 and Samarium-153 are widely available systemically administered radionuclides that are useful for the treatment of widely disseminated disease, and have largely supplanted the use of hemi-body irradiation. Combined with appropriate medical and surgical interventions, as well as the appropriate use of analgesics, radiotherapy is a well-tolerated and highly effective tr eatment for the palliation of symptomatic bone metastases.

Currently, a standard practice is to treat patients indefinitely until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. A systematic approach to providing breaks in treatment schedules (intermittent chemotherapy) for patients who experience an initial response to chemotherapy may avoid or delay the development of pr ogressive toxicity. Whether continuous therapy offers an advantage over intermittent therapy, in terms of balancing disease control and overall survival with treatment-related toxicities and quality-of-life (QOL) is yet unanswered. This article will: (1) review the data from prior studies of intermittent versus continuous chemotherapy in other solid tumors, (2) review existing trials of intermittent chemotherapy in prostate cancer, (3) discuss intermittent chemotherapy clinical trial design considerations, and (4) discuss the future role of intermittent chemotherapy for the treatment of prostate cancer.

In vitro data suggest that the combined cytotoxicity may be sequence dependent. Thus, we explored the combined effects of the 2 agents, both in vitro and in vivo. Patients and Methods: The combined cytotoxicity of paclitaxel and 5-fluorouracil, and the possible schedule dependence were studied in vitro using PC-3 and DU145 cells and the microculture tetrazolium assay. There were 23 patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer treated with the regimen T-HDFL: paclitaxel 90 mg/m SUP 2 intravenously 1 hour on days 1 and 8; 5-fluorouracil 2000 mg/m SUP 2; and leucovorin 300 mg/m SUP 2 intravenous 24-hour infusion on days 2 and 9, which repeated every 21 days. The allowed percentage of bone marrow irradiation was 50%. Results: Significant synergistic cytotoxicity was seen only when paclitaxel was given 24 hours before 5-fluorouracil. With the T-HDFL regimen, 11 (52%) of the 21 evaluable patients had >=50% reduction of prostate-specific antigen, lasting for 6 weeks. Of the 7 patients with measurable disease, 2 had a partial response. Median overall survival was 14.1 months. Grade III/IV leukopenia occurred in 2 patients. There was no treat ment-related death. Toxicities were well tolerated. Conclusions: The combined cytotoxicity of paclitaxel and 5-fluorouracil is schedule dependent. It is feasible to administer weekly paclitaxel and high-dose 5-fluorouracil infusions in patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer. Our findings may serve as an important rationale for future trial design. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In vitro data suggested that tamoxifen could enhance the cytotoxic effect of chemotherapeutic agents, including doxorubicin, on prostate cancer cell lines. We applied this observation into a phase II trial for patients with hormone refractory prostate cancer (HRPC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: The AFL-T regimen consisted of doxorubicin 30 mg/m2/day on day 1; 5-FU 2,000 mg/m2/day 24-hour infusion and leucovorin 200 mg/m2/day 24-hour infusion on days 15 and 29; tamoxifen 50 mg/m2 four times daily on days 1, 2, 16, 17, 30, and 31. The protocol was designed to be of low dose-intensity and tolerable to most HRPC patients who may have reduced bone marrow reserve and poor renal function. Between Feb. 1994 and April 1999, 17 patients (median age 67, range 60-81) with HRPC were enrolled. Extensive hormonal manipulations had been done prior to the chemotherapy. Three patients had measurable diseases, 14 had only bone metastases, and all had elevated PSA levels (median 498 ng/ml, range 7.4-3,970 ng/ml). RESULTS: All 17 patients were eligible for analysis of toxicity. ECOG Grade III/IV leukopenia and thrombocytopenia occurred in 1 and 3 patients, respectively. There was no febrile neutropenia; there was no treatment-related mortality. Grade III/IV nausea, vomiting, mucositis, and diarrhea were noted in 0, 0, 1 and 0 patient, respectively. There was no venous thrombosis. One partial response, 1 stable disease, and 1 progressive disease were found in the three patients with measurable lesions. Eleven of the 17 patients (64.7%, 95% confidence interval: 41-88%) who were eligible for the evaluation of PSA response (PSA decrease > 50% for at least 6 weeks) were responders. The median overall and progression-free survivals were 13 and 7 months, respectively. Seventy-six percent of patients showed decreased analgesic usage or enhanced performance status. CONCLUSION: AFL-T, that has a low toxicity profile, is comparable to most other active regimens in terms of the PSA response rate. Randomized trials are needed to determine if there exists a survival benefit for patients with HRPC","","","","","","","Department of Oncology, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan","PM:11396219","","","",""

In contrast, bone lesions associated with prostate cancer are predominately osteoblastic. Zoledonic acid (Zol) is a new-generation bisphosphonate that is approximately 2-3 orders of magnitude more potent than pamidronate (Pam) in preclinical models and has demonstrated clinical efficacy in patients with both lytic and blastic lesions. Zoledonic acid (4 mg via 15 min infusion) every 3-4 weeks was directly compared to Pam (90 mg via 2 hr infusion) in 767 patients with breast cancer and bone metastases. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients experiencing a skeletal-related event (SRE) over 13 months. Zoledonic acid was as effective as Pam, and the proportion of Zol-treated patients with an SRE (42% in the hormonal therapy strata and 44% in the chemotherapy strata) was comparable to the original studies comparing Pam to placebo. Among 371 breast cancer patients receiving hormonal therapy, the proportion of patients with an SRE was 47% for Pam vs. 57% for placebo (P = 0.057), and among 380 patients treated with chemotherapy, the proportions with an SRE were 43% for Pam vs. 56% for placebo (P = 0.008) at 12 months. Zoledronic acid (4 mg) has been compared to placebo in a randomized Phase III trial involving 422 men with hormone-refractory prostate cancer metastatic to bone. Zoledonic acid demonstrated a significant advantage over placebo for median time to first SRE (median not reached for Zol vs. 321 days for placebo; P = 0.011), the proportion of patients with an SRE over 15 months (33 vs. 44% for placebo; P = 0.021), and mean skeletal morbidity rate (number of SREs/time, 0.08 vs. 1.49 for placebo; P = 0.006). In addition, the effects of Zol were apparent early. At 3 months, only 12% of Zol-treated patients had an SRE vs. 23% for placebo (P = 0.003), and at 6 months, the proportions were 21 vs. 31% for placebo (P = 0.025). In contrast, a previous study of Pam in 236 prostate cancer patients found that Pam was no more effective than placebo in reducing bone pain or SREs over 6 months. In these studies, Zol was well tolerated with a safety profile similar to other IV bisphosphonates. In conclusion, Zol is the first bisphosphonate to demonstrate efficacy in both lytic and blastic disease. The unique properties of this novel agent should be further explored in future clinical trials","","","","","","","Milton S. Hershey Medical Center, P.O.

The primary efficacy analysis was the proportion of patients with one or more skeletal-related events (SREs), which were defined as pathologic fracture, spinal cord compression, radiation therapy, or surgery to bone. Secondary analyses included time to first SRE, skeletal morbidity rate (events per year), disease progression, and multiple event analysis.RESULTS: In this subset of 74 patients with RCC, zoledronic acid (4 mg) was found to significantly reduce the proportion of patients with an SRE (37% vs. 74% for placebo; P = 0.015). Similarly, zoledronic acid significantly reduced the mean skeletal morbidity rate (2.68 vs. 3.38 for placebo; P = 0.014) and extended the time to the first event (median not reached vs. 72 days for placebo; P = 0.006). A multiple event analysis demonstrated that the risk of developing an SRE was reduced by 61% compared with placebo (hazard ratio of 0.394; P = 0.008). The median time to progression of bone lesions was significantly longer for patients who were treated with zoledronic acid (P = 0.014 vs. placebo). Zoledronic acid appeared to be well tolerated; the most common adverse events in all treatment groups included bone pain, nausea, anemia, and emesis.CONCLUSIONS: Zoledronic acid (4 mg as a 15-minute infusion) demonstrated significant clinical benefit in patients with bone metastases from RCC, suggesting that further investigation of zoledronic acid in this patient population is warranted","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Patients who receive adjuvant hormonal therapy for breast cancer or androgen-deprivation therapy for prostate cancer are at an especially high risk for CTIBL because of reduced estrogenic signaling. Oral clodronate (Bonefos; Anthra Pharmaceuticals; Princeton, NJ), oral risedronate (Actonel; Proctor and Gamble Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; Cincinnati, OH), and i.v. zoledronic acid (Zometa; Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corp.; East Hanover, NJ) have all demonstrated promise in preventing CTIBL in patients receiving hormonal therapy for breast cancer. Zoledronic acid has demonstrated efficacy with the longest between-treatment interval (3-6 months) and is currently being investigated in the Zometa/Femara Adjuvant Synergy Trials (Z-FAST and ZO-FAST in the United States and Europe, respectively). In patients receiving androgen-deprivation therapy for prostate cancer, i.v. pamidronate (Aredia; Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corp.) and i.v. zoledronic acid both have demonstrated significant benefits over placebo, but only zoledronic acid produced significant increases in bone mineral density compared with baseline values. Additionally, bisphosphonates have demonstrated antitumor activities in preclinical models, and clinical trials with oral clodronate suggest that bisphosphonates might prevent or delay bone metastasis in patients with early-stage breast cancer. Clinical trials are investigating the effect of zoledronic acid on disease progression in patients with breast cancer, prostate cancer, and non-small cell lung cancer.

Therefore, a subset analysis of a larger clinical trial was performed to determine the efficacy of zoledronic acid in renal cell carcinoma patients. Patients with bone metastases from solid tumors other than breast or prostate cancer (n=773) were randomized to receive zoledronic acid or placebo via 15-minute infusion every 3 weeks for 9 months. Patients were monitored for skeletal-related events, which were defined as pathological fracture, spinal cord compression, radiotherapy, or surgery to bone. Among the subset of 74 patients with renal cell carcinoma, 46 patients were treated with 4 mg of zoledronic acid or placebo. Significantly fewer patients treated with 4 mg zoledronic acid had a skeletal-related event (37% versus 74% for placebo, P=0.015), and zoledronic acid significantly prolonged the time to first skeletal-related event (median not reached at 9 months versus 72 days for placebo; P=0.006). Zoledronic acid significantly reduced the annual incidence of skeletal-related events by approximately 21% (mean 2.68 versus 3.38 events per year for placebo, P=0.014) and significantly reduced the risk of developing a skeletal-related event by 61% compared with placebo (risk ratio=0.394, P=0.008) by multiple event analysis. Median time to progression of bone lesions was also significantly extended with zoledronic acid treatment (P=0.014). Zoledronic acid is the first bisphosphonate to significantly reduce skeletal morbidity and significantly prolong time to bone lesion progression in patients with bone metastases from renal cell carcinoma","","","","","","10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-040030 [doi];10/18/6397S [pii]","Milton S.

The bone mineral matrix contains numerous growth factors that are released during normal bone remodeling, providing a fertile microenvironment for tumor cell colonization and proliferation. Tumor cells then release a variety of growth factors that promote bone resorption and increase the risk of skeletal complications. Bisphosphonates are potent inhibitors of osteoclast activity that have demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of bone metastases. Bisphosphonates bind avidly to the bone matrix, are released during bone resorption, and are subsequently internalized by osteoclasts, where they interfere with biochemical pathways and induce osteoclast apoptosis. Bisphosphonates also antagonize osteoclastogenesis and promote the differentiation of osteoblasts. As a result, bisphosphonates inhibit tumor-induced osteolysis and reduce skeletal morbidity. Furthermore, preclinical studies suggest that bisphosphonates possess antitumor activity and can inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis of tumor cell lines. In addition, zoledronic acid, a new-generation bisphosphonate, appears to inhibit tumor cell invasion of the extracellular matrix. These data suggest that zoledronic acid and other bisphosphonates may play a role in the reduction of skeletal tumor burden and the prevention of bone metastasis","","","","","","","Milton S.

These complications include bone pain, pathologic fractures, spinal cord compression, and hypercalcemia of malignancy (HCM), a potentially life-threatening condition. Treatment options include radiotherapy to palliate bone pain and/or prevent impending fracture, orthopedic surgery to prevent or repair fractures, analgesics, and bisphosphonates, which can significantly reduce the risk of skeletal complications and delay their onset. Of the known bisphosphonates, zoledronic acid is the most potent. Since its regulatory approval in the United States and Europe in 2001, zoledronic acid (4 mg by 15-minute infusion) has become widely used and has replaced pamidronate (90 mg by 2-hour infusion) as the standard of care for treating bone metastases from breast cancer and bone lesions from multiple myeloma. Zoledronic acid has also demonstrated significant long-term benefits in randomized trials in prostate cancer and other solid tumors, whereas other bisphosphonates have failed. In long-term, phase III clinical testing, zoledronic acid provided significant treatment benefits beyond those of pamidronate in patients with breast cancer and demonstrated a safety profile comparable with pamidronate. Therefore, zoledronic acid is now recommended from the first diagnosis of bone metastasis. Other intravenous bisphosphonates include clodronate and ibandronate. Both are approved in Europe, but their efficacy relative to pamidronate and zoledronic acid is not known","","","","","","","Penn State University, Milton S.

Patients who experience a skeletal-related event (SRE) are at higher risk for subsequent events. After an SRE such as a pathologic fracture, spinal cord compression, or the requirement for orthopedic surgery or palliative radiation therapy, a patient's quality of life and functional independence could decline substantially. Prevention or delay of skeletal complications provides clinical benefit to patients with bone metastases secondary to solid tumors. Treatment for the prevention of the first SRE might substantially improve patients' quality of life, functional independence, and pain throughout the course of their disease. Bisphosphonates have shown a palliative benefit in this setting. In particular, zoledronic acid is the only bisphosphonate that has provided benefits for patients with bone metastases secondary to a broad range of solid tumors. Among patients with metastatic breast or prostate cancer, zoledronic acid has demonstrated significant reductions in pain and skeletal morbidity compared with placebo. Zoledronic acid has also shown significant reductions in skeletal morbidity in patients with lung cancer or other solid tumors compared with placebo. Pamidronate, oral clodronate, and ibandronate compared with placebo have each shown significant benefits in reductions of pain and skeletal complications for patients with metastatic breast cancer. Further improvements in the management of skeletal health in patients with malignant bone disease could be achieved through ongoing bisphosphonate investigations to optimize dose, timing, and duration of treatment","","","","","","657LKG40M64GR7J4 [pii];10.3816/SCT.2007.n.003 [doi]","Pennsylvania State University, Milton S.

However, the relation between NTX decreases and clinical benefits is unclear. METHODS: Correlations between NTX normalization during treatment and clinical outcome were retrospectively analyzed in 3 large, phase 3 trials. Urinary NTX levels were measured at baseline and at Month 3 in patients with bone metastases from breast cancer (BC; n = 578), hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC; n = 472), or nonsmall-cell lung cancer and other solid tumors (NSCLC/OST; n = 291) who received zoledronic acid or control (pamidronate for BC; placebo for HRPC and NSCLC/OST) for up to 24 months. NTX levels were characterized as normal (N; <64 nmol/mmol creatinine) or elevated (E; > or =64 nmol/mmol creatinine). RESULTS: After 3 months of zoledronic acid, most N-group patients maintained normal levels; however, most E-group patients normalized their NTX levels (BC, 81%; HRPC, 70%; NSCLC/OST, 81%). In contrast, NTX levels normalized with pamidronate in 65% of BC, with placebo in 8% of HRPC, and in 17% of NSCLC/OST E-group patients. Normalized NTX correlated with improved overall survival versus persistently elevated NTX (significant for zoledronic acid-treated patients; trend for placebo-treated patients). Moreover, percentage reductions from baseline NTX levels correlated with benefits regardless of whether patients transitioned from E to N. CONCLUSIONS: Zoledronic acid normalizes or maintains normal NTX levels in most patients with bone metastases. Normalized NTX within 3 months of treatment, versus persistently elevated NTX, was associated with reduced risks of skeletal complications and death","","","","","","10.1002/cncr.23529 [doi]","Department of Hematology-Oncology, Milton S.

Currently, the only Food and Drug Administration-approved therapy for metastatic bone disease is bisphosphonate therapy. A greater understanding of the biomolecular pathways that govern the bone continuum of cancer has helped identify novel targets for drug development.

Given the cytostatic nature of the drug, the primary study end point was progression-free survival for a minimum of 6 months. The secondary end point was further characterization of drug toxicity. Results: A total of 26 patients was enrolled. Using the intent-to-treat population, stable disease was seen for an average of 19.2 weeks (median 12 weeks, range 3-108 weeks). Twenty patients were evaluable for response. The one patient that achieved disease stabilization for >2 years elected to come off-study because of patient preference. His last disease evaluation showed no evidence of progression. No objective responses were seen. Previous and ongoing clinical observations strongly imply that PSA could be a misleading surrogate marker for clinical effect with this type of drug. Therefore, prostate-specific antigen was not used as a marker for disease response. Toxicity was as expected with mild hypercalcemia and associated symptoms like constipation and prerenal azotemia seen in some patients. Six (30%) evaluable patients experienced stable disease for >6 months, suggesting possible cytostatic activity. Conclusion: The results of this and other trials suggest further clinical investigation in this disease with vitamin D analogues alone or in combination with other agents, such as chemotherapy, should be pursued","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recently, the realization that cancer cells exist in complex microenvironments that are essential for the tumorigenic and metastatic potential of the cancer cells is starting the redefine the paradigm for cancer therapy. The propensity of prostate cancer cells to metastasize to bone is leading to the design of novel therapies targeting both the cancer cell as well as the bone microenvironment. Tumor cells in the bone in teract with the extracellular matrix, stromal cells, osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and endothelial cells to promote tumor-cell survival and proliferation leading to a lethal phenotype that includes increased morbidity and mortality for patients with advanced prostate cancer. Several strategies are being developed that target these complex tumor cell-microenvironment interactions and target the signal transduction pathways of other cells important to the development of metastases, including the osteoclasts, osteoblasts, and endothelial cells of the bone microenvironment. Current and new therapies in metastatic prostate cancer will comprise a multitargeted approach aimed at both the tumor cell and the tumor microenvironment. Here, we review the c urrent therapeutic strategies for targeting the prostate cancer-bone microenvironment and several single- and multiagent targeted approaches to the treatment of advanced prostate cancer that are under development.

Methods: This single center, prospective study included 38 prostate cancer patients surgically or medically castrated who had PSA increases above their nadir after previous antiandrogen manipulation and in absence of bone metastases. Patients were given daily dose of bicalutamide 150 mg. Clinical evaluations and serum PSA testing were performed every 3 months. Respo nse was defined according to PSA decline from baseline as if < 50% or < 85%. The duration of response was the time from entering into study until PSA increased < 25% or < 2 ng/ml from the nadir. Bone scintigraphy was repeated at PSA increase or at symptom appearance. Results: The mean follow-up was 34.5 months (range, 3-75.2). A PSA decline was observed in 17 of 38 patients (44.7%): 7 (18.4%) < 85% and 10 (26.3%) < 50 but < 85% responders. The median duration of response was 18.5 months for partial and 37.4 months for complete responders. The median time to metastasis was 52.5 months for responders and 15.7 months for nonresponders (Log-Rank test 9.3, P = .002). Conclusions: High-dose bicalutamide can induce a second response in almost half of castration-resistant prostate cancer patients without metastasis. The duration of response is more than 1.5 years on average and responders have prolonged metastasis-free survival. (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All Rights Reserved","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Understanding the biology behind this striking clinical manifestation is the key to its effective treatment. A clinical trial using a bone-targeting radiopharmaceutical agent, strontium 89, combined with chemotherapy showed increased survival time among patients with progression of prostate cancer in bone, suggesting that therapeutic strategies focused on treating the tumor in bone are effective. We and others thus hypothesize that interactions between prostate cancer cells and the bone microenvironment play a role in the progression of prostate cancer in bone. Clinical trials and basic science investigations aiming to understand such interactions have been carried out in parallel. In the laboratory studies, human bone marrow specimens have been collected for identification of proteins involved in the bidirectional interactions between prostate cancer cells and bone. In addition, specimens from bone biopsies of the cancer lesions have been used to generate xenografts in animals to establish animal models for testing therapeutic strategies. Clinical trials using agents to inhibit the stromal-prostate cancer in teractions (e.g., docetaxel/ imatinib or thalidomide) have been done. Analyses of the specimens from these trials provided support of our hypothesis and future development of diagnosis and therapy strategies.

Our understanding of and ability to treat hormone-refractory prostate cancer is constantly evolving. There are numerous clinical trials underway to evaluate novel chemotherapeutic agents and their effectiveness against various stages of prostate cancer. Today's urologist has multiple treatment options available. The treatment strategies presented here include hormonal m anipulations, chemotherapeutic options, and adjunctive therapies, and can serve as a guide when caring for this patient population. A mutlidisciplinary approach is important to maximize patient survival and quality of life.

Immunotherapy using activated mononuclear cells is a way to harness the body's adaptive immune response to fight metastatic prostate cancer. Areas covered in this review: In 2005, at least 10 therapeutic cancer vaccines, designed to confer active, specific immunotherapy against tumor-associated antigens, were in clinical trials. These covered potential fields of immunological strategy to overcome castration-resistant prostate cancer. What the reader will gain: A literature review was performed using the search terms sipuleucel-T, Provenge and APC8015 or APC-8015, and restricted to English language articles from 2000 to 2010. The immunological design and development of sipuleucel-T are summarized. The efficacy and safety of sipuleucel-T are discussed based on current data from clinical trials. Ongoing clinical trials involving sipuleucel-T are summarized. Take home message: Efficacy and safety with sipuleucel-T has been demonstrated in Phase I/II trials. The latest data from a Phase III trial shows that sipuleucel-T has met the primary endpoint of survival benefit. Further work is needed to understand the mechanisms behind cancer vaccine failure and elucidate the population for whom this vaccine will be suitable.

PROCEDURES: Twenty consecutive patients with advanced prostate cancer underwent bone scintigraphy, followed by Ga-68-DOTATOC PET/CT within 3 weeks. Through side-by-side comparison with bone scintigraphy, the number of visible bone metastases on PET was determined. In addition, in cases of visible metastases, the maximum standard uptake value (SUV(max)) of Ga-68-DOTATOC was measured in the metastases and in normal bone. In patients who did not undergo a prostatectomy (n = 12), the SUV(max) was additionally measured in the prostate and in adjacent tissue. For focal lesions, the difference in SUV(max) (Delta SUV(max)) between the metastases and normal bone was calculated. For patients still having their prostate, a Delta SUV(max) between the prostate and its adjacent tissue was calculated. RESULTS: Sixty four of 216 metastases (30%) were visible in 13 patients with focal metastases. Of six patients with diffuse metastases (superscan), one showed diffuse metastases, three showed a total of ten focal metastases, and two showed no correlate on PET. One patient with a neuroendocrine prostate cancer showed no correlate on PET. The maximum Delta SUV(max) between metastases and normal bone was 4.9 (mean = 1.6 +/- 0.9) and between the prostate and adjacent tissue 5.9 (mean = 2.8 +/- 1.6). CONCLUSIONS: In prostate cancer and its bone metastases, DOTATOC-affine somatostatin receptors (subtype 2 and 5) can be visualized with Ga-68-DOTATOC PET/CT. But their expression is so weak that other conjugates should be tested for receptor-mediated therapies which are better at addressing the prostate cancer-specific somatostatin receptor subtypes 1 and 4-or even other receptors","","","","","","10.1007/s11307-009-0230-3 [doi]","Clinic and Policlinic of Nuclear Medicine, University Hospital Dresden, Dresden, Germany. wolfgang.luboldt@uniklinikum-dresden.de","PM:19421819","","","",""

What is the optimal timing of chemotherapy for metastatic hormone refractory prostate cancer? Should asymptomatic patients be treated? Is there a theoretical survival advantage for treatment for hormone sensitive prostate cancer? We reviewed arguments for the early use of docetaxel in the hormone sensitive and hormone naive disease states. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Androgen independent prostate cancer was traditionally viewed as a chemoresistant disease. At best palliation of bone pain but not improved survival could be achieved with the combination of mitoxantrone and prednisone. Median survival rates for chemotherapy in this disease state were reported to be between 10 and 12 months. Phase II studies administering docetaxel weekly or every 3 weeks as a single agent or in combination with estramustine demonstrated median survival rates of 14 to 23 months, which appeared to be an improvement over standard therapy. Consequently the 2 randomized trials, Southwest Oncology Group 99-16 and TAX 327, were designed to confirm the preliminary observations of improved survival with docetaxel based therapy. RESULTS: TAX 327 and Southwest Oncology Group 99-16 treated asymptomatic as well as symptomatic patients. Thus, in contrast with mitoxantrone/prednisone, which was approved in symptomatic men with hormone refractory prostate cancer, the exact timing of the initiation of chemotherapy in docetaxel treated patients is still the subject of debate. CONCLUSIONS: Studies should be performed to investigate the optimal timing of chemotherapy as well as sequencing with androgen ablation in patients at high risk for progression and death from metastatic prostate cancer. Prognostic factors for death that have been identified in patients with androgen independent prostate cancer are hemoglobin, alkaline phosphatase, visceral disease and performance status","","","","","","S0022-5347(06)01459-5 [pii];10.1016/j.juro.2006.06.077 [doi]","Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center, 161 Fort Washington Avenue, New York, NY 10032, USA","PM:17084173","","","",""

The conventional management of symptomatic bone lesions in patients with advanced cancer involves various combinations of local and systemic standard anticancer therapies and the symptomatic treatment of skeletal complications. In recent years, bisphosphonates have demonstrated high efficacy to avoid skeletal complications from metastatic bone lesions and to prevent cancer treatment-induced bone loss. Especially in the treatment of patients with bone metastases, secondary to breast cancer, a widespread use of bisphosphonates has been established. With the development of highly potent new-generation bisphosphonates, such as zoledronate, the therapeutic opportunities for bisphosphonates are going to expand. Several current studies have investigated the benefit of zoledronate therapy for bone metastases from a variety of tumor types, including prostate cancer, lung and renal cell cancer and multiple myeloma. Furthermore, bisphosphonates have been shown to significantly reduce antineoplastic therapy-induced bone loss. According to recently published data, it is suggested that bisphosphonates not only play a role in the inhibition of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption, but also have antitumor effects inhibiting tumor cell proliferation, adhesion and invasion, as well as angiogenesis and induction of apoptosis.

However, clinicians still confront a large group of men developing disease metastatic to bone. Adequate control of bone complications plays a fundamental role in achieving control of symptoms and quality of life in this group. Androgen deprivation therapy, the standard treatment for advanced prostate cancer, increases the risk of various complications, including bone disease. This review addresses the prevention of bone complications related not only to prostate cancer metastases but also to impaired bone integrity caused by androgen deprivation therapy.

These lesions also cause structural weakening of the pelvis, limping, and poor quality of life. Percutaneous acetabuloplasty is a mini-invasive procedure for the management of metastatic lesions due to carcinoma of the acetabulum performed in patients who cannot tolerate major surgery, or in patients towards whom radiotherapy had already proved ineffective. METHODS: We report a retrospective study in 25 such patients (30 acetabuli) who were evaluated before and after percutaneous acetabuloplasty, with regard to pain, mobility of the hip joint, use of analgesics, by means of evaluation forms: Visual Analog Scale, Harris Hip Score, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Index of Osteoarthritis (WOMAC), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG). The results obtained were analysed using the chi2 Test and Fisher's exact test. Significance was sent at P < 0.05. RESULTS: Marked clinical improvement was observed in all patients during the first six post-operative months, with gradual a worsening thereafter from deterioration of their general condition. Complete pain relief was achieved in 15 of our 25 (59%) of patients, and pain reduction was achieved in the remaining 10 (41%) patients. The mean duration of pain relief was 7.3 months. Pain recurred in three patients (12%) between 2 weeks to 3 months. No major complications occurred. There was transient local pain in most cases, and 2 cases of venous injection of cement without clinical consequences. CONCLUSION: Percutaneous acetabuloplasty is effective in improving the quality of life of patients with osteolytic bone tumours, even though the improvement is observed during the first 6 months only. It can be an effective aid to chemo- and radiotherapy in the management of acetabular metastases","","","","","","1471-2474-9-66 [pii];10.1186/1471-2474-9-66 [doi]","Department of Orthopaedics and Traumatology Catholic University, Agostino Gemelli Hospital - Rome, Italy. giuliomac@tiscali.it","PM:18457594","","","",""

It was the aim of this review to validate the significance of PET as a diagnostic tool in malignant tumors of the urogenital tract. A systematic review of the current literature concerning the role of PET for malignant tumors of the kidney, testicles, prostate, and bladder was carried out. The role of FDG PET for renal cell cancer can be seen in the detection of recurrences after definitive local therapy and metastases. The higher sensitivity of PET in comparison to other therapeutic modalities (CT, ultrasound, MRI) in recurrent and metastatic renal cell cancer suggests a supplemental role of this diagnostic procedure to complement other imaging modalities.The clinical value of PET is established for the identification of vital tumor tissue after chemotherapy of seminomatous germ cell tumors. This diagnostic method has little significance for primary tumor staging and diagnosis of non-seminomatous germ cell tumor because of the high probability of false-negative results in adult teratomas. FDG PET is not sensitive enough in the diagnosis of primary or recurrent tumors in prostate or bladder cancer. Also PET did not prove to be superior to conventional bone scintigram in the detection of mostly osteoblastic metastases in prostate cancer. The recent use of alternative tracers, which are partly not eliminated by urinary secretion (acetate, choline) has increased the sensitivity and specificity of PET also in this tumor entity so that further clinical investigations are needed to validate these technical modifications in their significance for this imaging modality. PET appears to be sufficiently evaluated only for the diagnostic follow-up of patients with seminomatous germ cell tumors after chemotherapy to regard it is the diagnostic tool of first choice. For all other tumors of the urogenital tract this proof is still awaited","","","","","","10.1007/s00120-004-0714-3 [doi]","Klinik fur Urologie und Kinderurologie, Medizinische Hochschule, Hannover. machtens.stefan@mh-hannover.de","PM:15502907","","","",""

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible patients had metastatic prostate cancer and had received combined androgen blockade for 6-8 months with a > or = 80% decrease in prostate-specific antigen from pretreatment. They received 4 cycles of chemotherapy consisting of estramustine 280 mg orally 3 times daily, etoposide 50 mg/m2 orally on days 1-14, and paclitaxel 135 mg/m2 intravenously for 1 hour on day 2 of each 21-day cycle and were then followed until time to treatment failure (TTF). RESULTS: Twenty-six patients were evaluable for response and toxicity. Median TTF was 21.7 months (range, 11.9-64.5 months; 95% confidence interval, 15.3-26.2 months). Median survival from time of initiation of hormone therapy was 5.1 years. Neutropenia was the most common grade 3/4 toxicity, occurring in 3 patients. Significant toxicities were limited to nausea, diarrhea, and febrile neutropenia in 3 patients, respectively. CONCLUSION: The administration of paclitaxel/estramustine/etoposide in this setting is feasible and well tolerated. Although the TTF of 21.7 months by prostate-specific antigen criteria is similar to historical controls in the emergence of clinically evident androgen-independent disease after starting hormone therapy, direct comparisons cannot be made.

Osteoporosis is a common complication of ADT. The aim of our study was to evaluate the efficacy of neridronate, a relatively new bisphosphonate to prevent bone loss during androgen ablation. METHODS: Sixty patients with prostate cancer and osteoporosis were enrolled and randomly assigned to 2 different treatment regimes: group A (30 patients) treated with maximum androgenic blockage (MAB), and group B (30 patients) treated with bicalutamide 150 mg. Each group was divided in 2 subgroups A1-A2 and B1-B2. All patients received calcium and cholecalciferol supplements (500 mg of elemental calcium and 400 IU cholecalciferol) daily. The A2 and B2 subgroups were also treated with neridronate (25 mg intramuscular monthly). Lumbar and femoral bone mineral density (BMD) was evaluated by dualenergy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), both at baseline and after one year of treatment. Deoxypyridinoline (DPD) and bone-alkaline phosphatase (B-ALP) were determined at the beginning, midstudy and at the end. RESULTS: Patients treated only with calcium and cholecalciferol (A1, B1 subgroups) showed a marked bone loss after 6, and 12 months, with increased levels of DPD and BALP, compared to baseline values. Patients treated with neridronate (A2 et B2 subgroups) showed unchanged levels of these markers. After one year of treatment, lumbar and total hip BMD decreased significantly in patients treated only with calcium and cholecalciferol (A1 subgroup: -4.9% and -1.9% respectively). BMD did not change significantly at any site in patients treated also with neridronate (A2 subgroup: +1% and +0.8% respectively). Lumbar and total hip BMD did not change significantly (-1.5% and -1% respectively) in B1 subgroup. In B2 subgroup an important increase in lumbar spine and the total hip BMD was shown (+2.5% and 1.6% respectively). No relevant side effects were recorded during our study. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, neridronate is an effective and safe treatment in preventing bone loss in men receiving ADT for prostate cancer","","","","","","S0302-2838(05)00029-1 [pii];10.1016/j.eururo.2005.01.012 [doi]","Department of Urology, University of Messina, Via Garibaldi 118, 98122, Messina, Italy. carlo.magno@tin.it","PM:15826746","","","",""

No effect was observed with unfused canstatin. The long lasting circulating blood level of CanHSA (20 ng ml(-1)) resulted in a profound disorganization of the tumor blood vessel network. However, when used as a curative treatment, on well-established tumors, CanHSA electrogenetherapy was ineffective in reducing tumor growth. As radiation is known to increase the alpha v beta3 and alpha v beta5 integrins, which are canstatin receptors, to extend the use of CanHSA electrogenetherapy, as a curative treatment, we explored the combination of CanHSA and ionizing radiation.

Strategies for the optimal management of SREs with bisphosphonates are explored. METHODS: Existing and novel therapies were identified and published guidelines were reviewed through PubMed key word searches. RESULTS: Nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates effectively reduce the risk of SREs in patients with bone metastases from a variety of solid tumors and bone lesions from multiple myeloma. Review of placebo-controlled trials in breast cancer patients with bone metastases indicated that zoledronic acid produced the greatest SRE risk reduction of all bisphosphonates evaluated. Zoledronic acid has demonstrated significant long-term benefits for prevention of SREs and palliative effects for bone pain. Zoledronic acid also improves quality of life. Analysis of recent trials indicates that early zoledronic acid intervention provides greater benefit in asymptomatic patients. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with malignant bone disease are at a continuous risk for SREs, and bisphosphonates reduce the incidence and delay the onset of SREs. Zoledronic acid has demonstrated the greatest SRE risk reduction of all bisphosphonates and significantly improves pain scores in patients with breast cancer.

METHODS: Available published clinical studies of oral bisphosphonates in bone metastases from 1980 to the present were identified through a MEDLINE search and from literature references. Data were reviewed for efficacy and safety, with an emphasis on double blind, placebo-controlled studies; clinically relevant endpoints; and appropriate study methodology. RESULTS: Etidronate, alendronate, pamidronate, risedronate, and tiludronate currently are available in the U.S. as either intravenous and/or oral formulations. Although newer bisphosphonates are more potent, oral bioavailability remains < 1%. Oral etidronate has been found to be ineffective in patients with multiple myeloma and prostate carcinoma bone metastases. Pamidronate has been found to be effective in reducing skeletal morbidity associated with bone metastases in both multiple myeloma and breast carcinoma patients when given intravenously, but is ineffective orally in multiple myeloma patients. To the authors' knowledge, there are no double blind, placebo-controlled trials of oral pamidronate in patients with breast carcinoma and bone metastases. Several clinical trials with clodronate, a bisphosphonate that is not available in the U.S., have shown mixed results in patients with myeloma and breast carcinoma bone metastases. To the authors' knowledge, there are no published trials evaluating oral alendronate, tiludronate, or risedronate in patients with metastases to bone. CONCLUSIONS: Oral bisphosphonates do not appear to be as effective as intravenous administration in reducing skeletal complications in patients with metastases to bone lesions. Low oral bioavailability is the most likely reason for this difference. Oral dosing should not be substituted for intravenous administration in the treatment of malignant osteolysis","","","","","","10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(20000101)88:1<6::AID-CNCR3>3.0.CO;2-D [pii]","Hamilton Regional Cancer Center, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada","PM:10618600","","","",""

This article discusses the selection of endpoints and statistical methods used to assess clinical efficacy of bisphosphonate therapies in patients with bone metastases. Recent studies of pamidronate and zoledronic acid have set the standards for the design and conduct of multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trials to assess the clinical benefit of bisphosphonates in patients with bone metastases. Studies of zoledronic acid have demonstrated objective, significant, and enduring benefits in patients with a broad range of primary cancers, including prostate cancer, using robust clinical endpoints. Other bisphosphonates, including clodronate, have been investigated for the treatment of bone metastases, but these studies have been relatively small. This review first considers issues of trial design and analysis, with particular emphasis on the statistical requirements for the rigorous analysis of multiple events occurring in the same patient, and then reviews the results of bisphosphonate trials in patients with breast or prostate cancers metastatic to bone in the light of these statistical considerations","","","","","","","Hamilton Regional Cancer Center, Department of Medicine, McMaster University, 699 Concession St., Hamilton, Ontario, Canada L8V 5C2","PM:12562046","","","",""

Analysis of such a composite endpoint provides insight into the clinical impact of the disease. However, SREs typically occur in a complex pattern. Recently, zoledronic acid (4 mg) was approved for the treatment of bone metastases secondary to all solid tumors and primary bone lesions from multiple myeloma based on significant benefits from first-event and skeletal morbidity rate analyses. However, multiple-event methods can provide information about the risk of SREs over the entire course of follow-up and address interpatient variation in event rates and temporal trends. Moreover, multiple-event methodology can adjust for survival, which has an effect on SRE incidence. Herein we present a survival-adjusted multiple-event analysis of the cumulative incidence of radiation to bone (a homogenous endpoint) and SREs (a composite endpoint) in 3 large, randomized clinical trials of zoledronic acid (4 mg) in patients with prostate cancer, lung cancer and other solid tumors, or breast cancer. In patients with prostate cancer, zoledronic acid significantly reduced the cumulative incidence of SREs compared with placebo (P = 0.002) as it did among patients with lung cancer and other solid tumors (P = 0.025). In patients with breast cancer, zoledronic acid significantly reduced the cumulative incidence of SREs compared with pamidronate 90 mg over 25 months (P = 0.050). These results are consistent with those obtained using established methods, supporting the validity of the survival-adjusted cumulative mean function for assessing benefits during bisphosphonate therapy","","","","","","35668374150254P0 [pii];10.3816/SCT.2005.n.017 [doi]","McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada","PM:18628179","","","",""

To evaluate the cause and significance of elevated activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) in a group of patients who received a first-generation adenoviral vector (Ad-OC-TK) delivering a toxic gene to prostate cancer cells as part of a Phase I clinical trial at the University of Virginia. Methods. Eleven subjects were injected intratumorally to metastatic lesions of prostate cancer in the prostatic fossa, retroperitoneal lymph nodes, or bone (iliac, ischium, or vertebrae). After the initial laboratory evaluation, patients with elevated aPTT underwent a series of additional tests, including mixing studies, coagulation factor, prekallikrein, and high- molecular-weight kininogen, and lupus anticoagulant studies (modified Russell viper venom time) with phospholipid correction, and a Staclot LA assay. Results. Of the 11 subjects who were enrolled in the trial, 6 had elevated aPTT values. Of the 6 patients, 3 had aPTT elevation of more than 10 seconds above normal. Two of the subjects with higher values demonstrated an inhibitory pattern with the factor VIII and XI assays, and the lupus anticoagulant studies were positive. No clinical sequelae to the elevated aPTT values were observed. Conclusions. This is, to our knowledge, the first formal report of a first-generation adenoviral vector causing a slight transient elevation of the aPTT through the induction of an antiphospholipid antibody. No clinical sequelae related to elevated aPTT values were observed. The adenoviral protocol was safe; similar protocols should be aware of this phenome non.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 139 patients from 22 Spanish hospitals were randomly assigned to: Group A, administered a single dose of 8 Gy+zoledronic acid (4 mg iv, in 15-min infusions), and Group B, administered a single dose of 6 Gy+zoledronic acid (4 mg iv, in 15-min infusions). The main variable was pain, which was assessed with the Visual Analogue Pain Scale (VAS) in supine, seated and standing positions. RESULTS: There was a total of 118 patients for intention to treat (n=67 in Group A and n=51 in Group B). The most frequent primary neoplasms were the lung (29.66%), prostate (22.03%) and breast (21.19%). Sixty patients were analysed per protocol, n=34 in group A and n=26 in group B. Improvements were observed in the VAS scores for pain in all three positions. The mean time to onset of the event was greater (p=0.0211) in Group A than in Group B (122 vs. 81.62 days). Functional status improved in Group A, and quality of life improved in both groups. CONCLUSION: The two groups achieved similar levels of pain control in supine, seated and standing positions. Quality of life also improved in both groups.

Operative intervention is indicated for patients who fail to respond adequately to nonoperative treatment. We evaluated the functional and oncological outcome of acetabular reconstruction after curettage for the treatment of refractory symptomatic acetabular metastases. METHODS: Fifty-five patients with metastatic disease of the acetabulum were treated with operative acetabular reconstruction combined with a total hip replacement. The most common primary tumor was carcinoma of the breast (eighteen patients), followed by carcinoma of the kidney (seven patients) and carcinoma of the prostate (seven patients). Forty (73 percent) of the patients presented with multiple skeletal metastases, and eighteen (33 percent) had associated visceral metastases. Twenty-eight (51 percent) had severe pain requiring continuous use of narcotics, twenty-four (44 percent) had moderate pain requiring periodic use of narcotics, and the remaining three (5 percent) had mild pain requiring use of non-narcotic analgesics. Eighteen (33 percent) of the patients could not walk, twenty-three (42 percent) needed a walker or crutches, twelve (22 percent) used a single cane, and two (4 percent) walked without assistive devices. Intralesional curettage of the tumor was performed in all of the patients. Fifty-four of the hips were reconstructed with a protrusio cup and one, with a hemipelvis endoprosthesis. Large defects were reinforced with cement and pin or screw fixation (the modified Harrington technique), which allowed transmission of weight-bearing forces to the remaining intact pelvis. Thirty-six acetabular reconstructions were performed with antegrade pins or cannulated screws; fifteen, with long retrograde screws; and four, with cement. RESULTS: The median period of survival was nine months. Patients with visceral metastases had a median period of survival of three months compared with twelve months for patients without visceral metastases (p < 0.001). Patients with breast cancer presented later in the disease process (p < 0.004) and lived longer than did those with other carcinomas (p < 0.004). Forty-five patients were evaluated three months after reconstruction. Thirty-four (76 percent) of them had relief of pain as determined by decreased use of narcotics. Nine of the eighteen patients who could not walk preoperatively regained the ability to walk. Fourteen of the seventeen patients who originally were able to walk in the community retained that ability. Thirty-three patients were available for evaluation at six months. Twenty-five (76 percent) still had relief of pain, and nineteen (58 percent) were able to walk and function in the community. Overall, fourteen (25 percent) of the fifty-five patients had moderate local progression of the disease, and five of these patients had failure of the fixation. Fourteen early complications developed in twelve (22 percent) of the patients. One patient (2 percent) died perioperatively. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who have acetabular metastases that are refractory to radiation and chemotherapy have a short life expectancy. The early, gratifying results of reconstruction validate the role of operative treatment as a short-term palliative procedure. Protrusio acetabular cups presumably compensate for deficiencies of the medial wall, while cement and pin fixation can be used effectively to reconstruct large defects in the acetabular column and dome. The low rate of fixation failure supports the biomechanical principles of the reconstruction. Generally, the reconstructions are sufficiently durable to exceed the life expectancy of the patients","","","","","","","Department of Surgery, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021, USA","PM:10819275","","","",""

We examined the effects of inhibiting uPAR signaling by inhibition of uPAR expression with antisense oligonucleotides (aODNs) in PC3 human prostate cancer cells and evaluated aODN effect in a mouse model of prostate cancer bone metastasis. Following uPAR aODN treatment, PC3 cells exhibited a strong decrease in uPAR expression, evaluated by flow cytometry and by polymerase chain reaction, and of FAK/JNK/Jun phosphorylation. The synthesis of cyclins A, B, D1 and D3 was inhibited, as shown by Western blotting, flow cytometry and polymerase chain reaction, and PC3 cells accumulated in the G2 phase of the cell cycle. PC3 cells' adhesion was unaffected, while proliferation and invasion of Matrigel were impaired. A total of 60 mice were subjected to intracardiac injection of PC3 cells and were randomly assigned to three groups: aODN (treated with 0.5 mg intraperitoneum/mouse/day), dODN (treated with the same amounts of a degenerated ODN) and control (injected with a saline solution). At 28 days after heart injection, mice were subjected to a digital scan of total body radiography, which revealed 80% reduction in mice affected by bone metastasis. The use of uPAR aODNs produced a substantial prophylactic effect against prostate cancer bone metastasis, which has to be ascribed to downregulation of uPAR expression","","","","","","3302456 [pii];10.1038/sj.gt.3302456 [doi]","Department of Experimental Pathology and Oncology, University of Florence, Italy","PM:15674398","","","",""

The appropriate timing of androgen blockade for advanced prostate cancer is controversial. Despite many phase-III studies, gaps in clinical information still remain, and some questions are still not conclusively answered. This review concentrates on high-level evidence to address common clinical situations in advanced and metastatic prostate cancer.

Tumours that compromise bone or nervous structures due to the bone destruction process are the most painful. There are several treatments to deal with pain (and other symptoms) caused by bone metastases. The hormone, calcitonin, has the potential to relieve pain, and also retain bone density, thus reducing the risk of fractures. This review is an update of a previously published review in The Cochrane Library (Issue 3, 2003). OBJECTIVES: Assess the effectiveness of calcitonin in controlling metastatic bone pain and reducing bone complications (hypercalcemia, fractures and nerve compression) in patients with bone metastases. SEARCH STRATEGY: Electronic searches were performed in MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, specialised registers of the Cochrane Cancer Network and of the Cochrane Pain, Palliative and Supportive Care Group in 2005. Registers of clinical trials in progress were also searched. SELECTION CRITERIA: Studies were included if they were randomised, double-blind clinical trials of patients with metastatic bone pain, treated with calcitonin, where the major outcome measure was pain, assessed at four weeks or longer. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Study selection and data extraction were performed by two independent review authors. Only two studies (90 participants) were eligible for inclusion in the review and therefore meta-analysis of the data was not possible. Intention-to-treat analysis was performed by imputing all missing values as adverse outcomes. MAIN RESULTS: Of the two small included studies, one study showed a non-significant effect of calcitonin in the number of patients with total pain reduction (RR 2.50; CI 95%, 0.55 to 11.41). The second study provided no evidence that calcitonin reduced analgesia consumption (RR 1.05; CI 95%, 0.90 to 1.21) in patients with painful bone metastases. There was no evidence that calcitonin was effective in controlling complications due to bone metastases; for improving quality of life; or patients' survival. Although not statistically significant, a greater number of adverse effects were observed in the groups given calcitonin in the two included studies (RR 3.35, CI 95%, 0.72 to 15.66). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The limited evidence currently available does not support the use of calcitonin to control pain from bone metastases. Since the last version of this review, none of the new relevant studies have provided additional information on this treatment, in contrast to other therapeutic approaches that should be considered. CALCITONIN USED TO TREAT METASTATIC BONE PAIN: The limited evidence currently available does not support the use of calcitonin to control pain arising from bone metastases. People who have cancer which has spread to their bones and the nerves adjacent to the bones often suffer severe pain. There are several treatments to help relieve this pain: radiotherapy; analgesic (pain relieving) drugs such as opioids; and bone modulating drugs such as bisphosphonates and calcitonin. Calcitonin has the potential to relieve pain and maintain bone strength, thus reducing the risk of bone fractures. This review looked at the effectiveness of calcitonin for controlling pain from bone metastases. However, few trials were found, and the evidence currently available does not support its use by patients suffering from bone pain. Until new studies provide additional information on this treatment, other therapeutic approaches should be considered","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Adjuvant bisphosphonate treatment improves outcomes of patients with bone metastasis-negative breast cancer, but the effects of bisphosphonates on bone metastases in prostate cancer are not known. METHODS: We performed a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial to determine whether a first-generation bisphosphonate could improve symptomatic bone metastasis-free survival (time to symptomatic bone metastases or death from prostate cancer) in men with nonmetastatic prostate cancer who were at high risk of developing bone metastases. Between June 1, 1994, and December 31, 1997, 508 men from 26 UK sites and one New Zealand site who were within 3 years of initial prostate cancer diagnosis with no evidence of metastases from current bone scanning were randomly assigned to daily oral sodium clodronate (2080 mg/day, n = 254) or placebo (n = 254) for a maximum of 5 years. Estimates of outcome risks were compared using Kaplan-Meier analyses. RESULTS: The groups allocated to each treatment were well balanced. After a median follow-up of nearly 10 years, no evidence of benefit to the clodronate group was observed in terms of bone metastases-free survival (clodronate versus placebo, 80 events versus 68 events; hazard ratio [HR] = 1.22; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.88 to 1.68) or overall survival (clodronate versus placebo, 130 deaths versus 127 deaths; HR = 1.02; 95% CI = 0.80 to 1.30). Adverse events, notably gastrointestinal problems and increased lactate dehydrogenase levels, were more frequent in the clodronate group than in the placebo group; otherwise, clodronate was well tolerated. Modification of trial drug dose was more frequent in the clodronate group than the placebo group (HR = 1.63, 95% CI = 1.21 to 2.19).

ThermoRods (Ablation Technologies, San Diego, California) are permanently implantable, 14 mm cobalt-palladium alloy rods that produce heat through oscillation of a magnetic field. The rod is designed to self-regulate the temperature to 70C by a temperature dependent magnetic transition (Curie effect). We determined whether patients with prostate cancer and local failure could be treated with thermal ablation of the prostate using this novel technology. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 14 men with an average age of 72 years (range 62 to 81) were enrolled in the study. All had biopsy proven prostate cancer with increasing prostate specific antigen (PSA) (1.0 to 10.3 ng/ml). The seminal vesicles were not routinely biopsied. Metastatic disease was assayed in all men with bone scan and in later patients with abdominopelvic computerized tomography. Patients had ThermoRods placed under transrectal ultrasound guidance, similar to brachytherapy. The pre-plan was rigorously followed to produce a 3-dimensional array with rods separated by 1 cm across the short axis. Patients were treated in a magnetic field for 1 hour. Urethral and rectal temperatures were also monitored and cooled appropriately. Serial PSA measurements and 6 month posttreatment biopsies were obtained after the procedure. RESULTS: Average time since radiation was 4.5 years. PSA nadir values after radiation were between 0.3 and 2.2 ng/ml. Prostatic temperatures were homogeneously increased greater than 50C, while rectal and urethral temperatures did not exceed 44C at any point. The urethral catheter was removed 2 weeks postoperatively in all cases. Six months after the procedure 8 of the 14 men (57%) had a PSA decrease to less than 0.1 ng/ml. Complications included urinary retention as well as incontinence. Incontinence was generally temporary and only 1 patient (7%) had long-term incontinence. Most patients were impotent after treatment. Of the patients 21% experienced urinary retention. Five patients (36%) needed to undergo secondary procedures after therapy, including transurethral prostate resection in 2, balloon dilation in 1, cystoscopic removal of necrotic tissue in 1 and bladder irrigation in 1. CONCLUSIONS: This novel means of thermal ablation produces significant PSA decreases in patients. Morbidity is predominantly in the form of incontinence and impotence. Incontinence is generally temporary. The use of ferromagnetic rods enables the precise control of tissue destruction with the sparing of immediately adjacent structures. The technology uses skills familiar to the urologist and avoids radiation. The durability of the PSA response and incidence of late morbidity remain to be defined","","","","","","00005392-200412010-00020 [pii]","Department of Urology, University of California UCSF Comprehensive Cancer Center San Francisco, San Francisco, California 94143-1695, USA. vmaster@urol.ucsf.edu","PM:15538231","","","",""

Interactions between malignant epithelial cells of prostate cancer and the bone microenvironment are implicated in the progression of prostate cancer. Because prostate cancer cells in bone metastases express the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), it is possible that inhibition of PDGFR can be an effective means of altering the clinical course of prostate cancer. Preclinical data suggest that preferential expression of PDGFRs in endothelial cells of tumor vasculature in experimental prostate cancer bone metastases is an important target for combination therapy incorporating the PDGFR inhibitor imatinib mesylate. Clinical trials combining imatinib and docetaxel are under way in the metastatic and neoadjuvant settings. Clinical and translational data from these studies are likely to provide additional insights into the role of imatinib in combination therapy for prostate cancer. (c) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Men with progressive castration-resistant prostate cancer with bone metastases (n = 144) were planned for equal randomization to i.v. 30 mg/m(2) docetaxel on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 every 42 days with 600 mg imatinib daily or placebo, for an improvement in median progression-free survival from 4.5 to 7.5 months (two-sided alpha = 0.05 and beta = 0.20). Secondary end points included differential toxicity and bone turnover markers, tumor phosphorylated PDGFR (p-PDGFR) expression, and modulation of p-PDGFR in peripheral blood leukocytes. RESULTS: Accrual was halted early because of adverse gastrointestinal events. Among 116 evaluable men (57 docetaxel + imatinib; 59 docetaxel + placebo), respective median times to progression were 4.2 months (95% confidence interval, 3.1-7.5) and 4.2 months (95% confidence interval, 3.0-6.8; P = 0.58, log-rank test). Excess grade 3 toxicities (n = 23) in the docetaxel + imatinib group were principally fatigue and gastrointestinal. Tumor p-PDGFR expression was observed in 12 of 14 (86%) evaluable bone specimens. In peripheral blood leukocytes, p-PDGFR reduction was more likely in docetaxel + imatinib-treated patients compared with docetaxel + placebo (P < 0.0001), as were reductions in urine N-telopeptides (P = 0.004) but not serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (P = 0.099).

To evaluate pharmacodynamic correlates of outcomes, we assessed the association of plasma platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) isoform kinetics and PDGFR inhibition with progression-free and overall survival by individual treatment arm. We found that in the docetaxel-placebo arm alone, the probability of decrease in PDGFR phosphorylation (Pr-Decr-pPDGFR) above 0.5 (vs </=0.5) was associated with a sharp increase in all measured plasma PDGF isoforms (P=0.006 for AA, 0.002 for BB, 0.045 for AB); a decreased median progression-free survival of 3.3 months vs 6.8 months (hazard ratio (HR) 2.5; P=0.006 in log-rank test) and an inferior median overall survival of 20 months vs >30 months (HR 3.1; P=0.04 in log-rank test). By contrast, in the docetaxel plus imatinib arm, the association of Pr-Decr-pPDGFR >0.5 with a rise in plasma PDGF isoform concentrations and inferior survival was not observed. The data suggest that dynamic changes in PDGFR phosphorylation in peripheral blood leukocytes predict docetaxel efficacy. Rising plasma PDGF concentrations may explain and/or mark docetaxel resistance.

Methods: Men with metastatic CRPC with prior taxane chemotherapy were planned for single-agent 'lead-in' lenalidomide for 21/28 days at dose-levels: -1 (5 mg), 0 (10 mg), +1 (15 mg), +2 (20 mg), +3 (25 mg); followed by lenalidomide at the same dose and schedule in combination with weekly intravenous paclitaxel 100 mg/m SUP 2 over 3 h on days 1, 8, 15 every 28 days utilizing a 3 + 3 dose-escalation design. Results: Dose-limiting toxicity was observed in 4/6 patients with first-cycle combination therapy at the 10 mg dose-level and 3/6 patients at the 5 mg dose-level of lenalidomide, respectively. These included Grade 3 neutropenia precluding planned paclitaxel therapy (n = 3), grade 3 gastro intestinal toxicity (n = 2), chest pain (n = 1) and pulmonary embolism (n = 1). With lead-in lenalidomide, two patients with lymph-node dominant CRPC had a PSA-decline and regression in lymph node disease, respectively. Two of seven evaluable patients had PSA declines by 50% with combination therapy. Progression-free survival was 13 weeks (range 4-35 weeks). Conclusions: The high dose-limiting toxicity rates observed with lenalidomide and weekly paclitaxel require exploration of alternate dose-schedules of the combination in the second-line setting of CRPC. These early observations suggest distinctive toxicity and efficacy outcomes from thalidomide in combination with paclitaxel. (c) 2010 Springer-Verlag","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The use of i.v. bisphosphonates as an adjunct to standard antineoplastic therapies in patients with advanced cancer is becoming widespread. Zoledronic acid and pamidronate (Zometa and Aredia, Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, East Hanover, NJ) are nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates. Pamidronate has been the standard of care for patients with osteolytic bone lesions from breast cancer or multiple myeloma. However, zoledronic acid, which has demonstrated increased potency and a broad clinical utility, is emerging as the new standard of care. In addition to treating hypercalcemia of malignancy, zoledronic acid is approved for treating patients with bone metastases (osteolytic or osteoblastic) from a wide range of solid tumors, including breast, prostate, and lung cancers, or osteolytic bone lesions from multiple myeloma. Zoledronic acid (4 mg via a 15-minute infusion) has a safety profile comparable with pamidronate (90 mg via a two-hour infusion) and has demonstrated comparable or superior efficacy to that of pamidronate in every patient population tested. The shorter infusion time of zoledronic acid compared with that of pamidronate may provide added convenience, but safety guidelines should be followed for all i.v. bisphosphonate therapies. These guidelines and nursing care of patients receiving i.v. bisphosphonates are reviewed","","","","","","","cmaxwell@ohgsf.com","PM:12929273","","","",""

METHODS: FCH has shown promise as a metabolic imaging agent for prostate carcinoma. Twenty-six patients with castration-resistant prostate carcinoma had FCH, BS and CT imaging within a 2-month period. Individual FCH-positive lesions in bone were compared to the BS and soft tissue lesions were compared to CT. The lesions were then classified as concordant or discordant for the presence or absence of prostate cancer metastases. Discordant bone or soft tissue lesions were followed up with BS or CT, respectively, at 6-month intervals for up to 2 years or until a definitive diagnosis of the discordant lesion could be made. RESULTS: In 13 (50%) of the patients, all lesions identified were concordant; this included 5 patients in whom no lesions could be identified with any imaging modality. In 21 patients, 183 lesions were observed with 149 being concordant and 34 (19%) being discordant (13 patients). Based on follow-up, FCH correctly identified the presence or absence of disease in 27 of 34 lesions, and in 14 cases FCH-positive lesions, not identified on initial imaging, were confirmed as disease on follow-up. The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive and negative predictive values for lesion detection by FCH are 96% (92-98%), 96% (81-99%), 96% (93-97%), 99% (96-100%) and 81% (64-88%), respectively, with 95% confidence intervals shown in parentheses. CONCLUSION: In this patient cohort, FCH shows good initial concordance (81%) with BS and CT in the detection of metastatic prostate carcinoma. Follow-up of the cases where FCH was initially discordant with subsequent BS or CT shows that FCH was accurate in determining the presence or absence of prostate metastasis in 79% of lesions. While FCH imaging as compared to BS and CT in this patient group has a good sensitivity and specificity for the detection of lesions representing prostate metastasis, further prospective studies are needed to determine its role","","","","","","10.1007/s00259-010-1579-x [doi]","Department of Nuclear Medicine, Royal Perth Hospital, Perth, WA, Australia.

In patients with advanced breast or prostate cancer, zoledronic acid 4 mg every 3-4 weeks for up to 15 months significantly reduced the proportion of patients with > or =1 skeletal-related event (SRE), excluding HCM, compared with placebo. In patients with advanced breast cancer or multiple myeloma, the incidence of SREs was similar in patients treated with zoledronic acid 4 mg or pamidronic acid 90 mg every 3-4 weeks for up to 25 months but, in breast cancer patients, zoledronic acid reduced the risk of SREs, including HCM, by an additional 20% compared with pamidronic acid. In modelled cost-utility studies comparing direct costs based on efficacy and resource-use data from these and/or other trials, results have varied. In the most recent study performed from the perspective of the UK NHS and modelled over a 10-year treatment period in women with advanced breast cancer, intravenous zoledronic acid and oral ibandronic acid were dominant over no treatment. Intravenous zoledronic acid was the most cost effective, in terms of incremental costs per QALY gained, followed by oral ibandronic acid, intravenous pamidronic acid and intravenous ibandronic acid. Two other modelled analyses in patients with advanced breast cancer, also conducted from the perspective of the NHS, evaluated the cost utility of three bisphosphonate therapies in patients receiving hormonal therapy or intravenous chemotherapy. Analyses were modelled over 14.3 months (i.e. expected survival) and assumptions varied markedly from results in clinical breast cancer trials. Also, efficacy assumptions for zoledronic acid were not based on clinical trials with the drug. The results of these analyses suggest that oral ibandronic acid is more cost effective than intravenous zoledronic acid and intravenous pamidronic acid in terms of incremental cost per QALY gained. In a global, 15-month modelled cost-effectiveness analysis of patients with advanced prostate cancer, conducted from a third-party perspective, the incremental cost per QALY gained for zoledronic acid versus no treatment was $US159 200 (year 2000 value), which is about 3-fold greater than commonly accepted thresholds for cost effectiveness. In conclusion, a recent modelled economic analysis suggests that intravenous zoledronic acid 4 mg is dominant relative to no treatment in the management of bone metastases in patients with advanced breast cancer. In contrast, in patients with advanced prostate cancer, the incremental cost per QALY gained for zoledronic acid 4 mg versus no treatment was predicted to be higher than commonly accepted thresholds. Compared with other bisphosphonates in the setting of advanced breast cancer, intravenous zoledronic acid was more cost effective than oral or intravenous ibandronic acid and intravenous pamidronic acid in one study, but less cost effective than oral ibandronic acid in another. Further efficacy and economic data comparing intravenous zoledronic acid with oral ibandronic acid are needed. Meanwhile, zoledronic acid appears to be the most cost effective intravenous bisphosphonate for the management of bone metastases in patients with advanced breast cancer and possibly in patients with different types of advanced solid tumours","","","","","","2637 [pii]","Wolters Kluwer Health | Adis, Auckland, New Zealand. demail@adis.co.nz","PM:18282018","","","",""

Fourteen patients with hormone refractory metastatic prostate cancer were treated with CaelyxTM 50 mg/m2 once every four weeks. All patients had radiologically proven bone metastases and three also had soft tissue metastatic disease. All patients were evaluable for toxicity and response was assessable in thirteen cases. Three PSA responses were documented in patients with non-measurable disease. No patient had an objective response in measurable disease. The commonest toxicity was cutaneous and this was dose limiting in two patients. Gastrointestinal upset was frequent but generally mild. One patient died shortly after an episode of neutropaenic sepsis with associated grade 3 mucositis following his third cycle of chemotherapy. We confirmed the toxicity profile of Caelyx but its modest antitumour efficacy in this group of patients suggests little promise for future study in metastatic prostate cancer","","","","","","","Department of Clinical Oncology, Grampian University Hospitals NHS Trust, Aberdeen, Scotland, UK","PM:12201496","","","",""

Most deaths from prostate cancer are due to metastatic disease that no longer responds to androgen deprivation. There have been several advances within the last decade leading to the approval of new agents for treating patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer. However, these agents can have significant side effects, and the average survival benefit from chemotherapy has been modest. Results from several clinical trials have suggested that immune-based therapies may have clinical benefits in patients with prostate cancer with significantly fewer adverse events. These new therapies, however, pose new potential benefits and risks. We review here two cellular immunotherapies furthest in clinical development for prostate cancer, and discuss the potential challenges to the treating oncologist with the possible advent of these new therapies.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In a prospective imaging trial, 43 patients underwent FDG-PET and BS prior to experimental therapies. Bone scan index (BSI) and standardized uptake value (SUV) on FDG-PET were recorded. Patients were followed until death (n = 36) or at least 5 years (n = 7). Imaging findings were correlated with survival. RESULTS: Osseous lesions were detected in 39 patients on BS and 32 on FDG-PET (P = 0.01). Follow-up was available for 105 FDG-positive lesions, and 84 (80%) became positive on subsequent BS. Prognosis correlated inversely with SUV (median survival 14.4 versus 32.8 months if SUVmax > 6.10 versus </= 6.10; P = 0.002) and BSI (14.7 versus 28.2 months if BSI > 1.27 versus < 1.27; P = 0.004). Only SUV was an independent factor in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: This study of progressive prostate cancer confirms earlier work that BSI is a strong prognostic factor. Most FDG-only lesions at baseline become detectable on follow-up BS, suggesting their strong clinical relevance. FDG SUV is an independent prognostic factor and provides complementary prognostic information","","","","","","1078-0432.CCR-10-1357 [pii];10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-10-1357 [doi]","Nuclear Medicine Service, Department of Radiology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10021, USA","PM:20975102","","","",""

We assess fracture risk following bilateral orchiectomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Through the Rochester Epidemiology Project we identified 429 Olmsted County, Minnesota men who underwent bilateral orchiectomy in 1956 to 2000, almost all for prostate cancer. Fractures were ascertained from comprehensive medical records and compared with expected numbers based on local incidence rates (standardized incidence ratio, SIR). Potential risk factors were assessed with proportional hazards models. RESULTS: During 1961 person-years of followup 161 men experienced 267 fractures, for a cumulative incidence after 15 years of 40% compared to 19% expected (p <0.001). However, 42 were pathological fractures and 82 were found incidentally on radiological surveys for metastasis. Overall fracture risk was increased (SIR 3.42, 95% CI 2.91-3.99) but was reduced by excluding the pathological and incidental fractures (SIR 2.04, 95% CI 1.66-2.47). The increase was largely accounted for by the moderate trauma fractures of the hip, spine and distal forearm traditionally linked with osteoporosis (SIR 3.50, 95% CI 2.71-4.43). In multivariate analyses risk factors for fractures generally included patient age, inactivity, prior radiological diagnosis of osteoporosis, chemotherapy and use of nonsteroidal antiandrogens, while independent risk factors for the traditional osteoporotic fractures included age, inactivity and diagnosis of osteoporosis. CONCLUSIONS: Fractures are common in men with prostate cancer due to advanced age, occurrence of pathological fractures and enhanced skeletal surveillance but there remains a significant increase in osteoporotic fracture risk following bilateral orchiectomy","","","","","","10.1097/01.ju.0000059281.67667.97 [doi];S0022-5347(05)63661-0 [pii]","Division of Epidemiology, Department of Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic and Foundation, 200 First Street SW, Rochester, MN 55905, USA","PM:12686824","","","",""

The lesions are usually sclerotic and appear late on the conventional X-ray. Bone scintigraphy is the mainstay of lesion detection, but is often not suitable for assessment of treatment response, particularly because of a flare phenomenon after therapy. Magnetic resonance imaging is increasingly used in assessment, and newer techniques allow quantitation. In addition to 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18 FDG), newer PET isotopes are also showing promise in lesion detection and response assessment. This article reviews the available imaging modalities for evaluating prostatic bony metastases, and links them to the underlying pathological changes within bone lesions.

However, the exact clinical role of bisphosphonates in MM remains unclear. OBJECTIVES: This update of the first review published in 2002. We have also analyzed observational studies targeting osteonecrosis of jaw (ONJ). SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the literature using the methods outlined in the previous review. We also searched observational studies or case reports examining ONJ. SELECTION CRITERIA: We selected RCTs with a parallel design related to the use of bisphosphonate in myeloma. We also selected observational studies or case reports examining bisphosphonates related to ONJ. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We have reported pooled data using either hazard ratio or risk ratio and, when appropriate, as absolute risk reduction and the number needed to treat to prevent or to cause a pathological event. We have assessed statistical heterogeneity and reported I2 statistic. MAIN RESULTS: This review includes 17 trials with 1520 patients analyzed in bisphosphonates groups, and 1490 analyzed in control groups. In comparison with placebo/no treatment, the pooled analysis demonstrated the beneficial effect of bisphosphonates on prevention of pathological vertebral fractures (RR= 0.74 (95% CI: 0.62 to 0.89), P = 0.001), total skeletal related events (SREs) (RR= 0.80 (95% CI: 0.72 to 0.89), P < 0.0001) and on amelioration of pain (RR = 0.75 (95% CI: 0.60 to 0.95), P = 0.01). We found no significant effect of bisphosphonates on overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), hypercalcemia or on the reduction of non-vertebral fractures. The indirect meta-analyses did not find the superiority of any particular type of bisphosphonate over others. Only two RCTs reported ONJ. The identified observational studies suggested that ONJ may be a common event (range: 0% to 51%). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Adding bisphosphonates to the treatment of MM reduces pathological vertebral fractures, SREs and pain but not mortality. Assuming the baseline risk of 20% to 50% for vertebral fracture without treatment, we estimate that between eight and 20 MM patients should be treated to prevent vertebral fracture(s) in one patient. Assuming the baseline risk of 31% to 76% for pain amelioration without treatment, we estimate that between five to 13 MM patients should be treated to reduce pain in one patient. Also, with the baseline risk of 35% to 86% for SREs without treatment, we estimate that between six and 15 MM patients should be treated to prevent SRE(s) in one patient. No bisphoshphonate appears to be superior to others. BISPHOSPHONATES IN MULTIPLE MYELOMA: Multiple myeloma (also known as myeloma or plasma cell myeloma) is a B-cell malignancy, or more precisely, plasma cell neoplasm. Multiple myeloma cells migrate to the bone marrow and continuously multiply. Thus, the cancer grows inside or outside of the bones. The bone damage, or osteolytic lesions, may lead to fractures of the long bones or compression fractures in the spine. The mechanism of bone destruction appears to be related to increased bone resorption by cells called osteoclasts. Bisphosphonates are drugs that can inhibit bone resorption by reducing the number and activity of osteoclasts. The review of trials shows that adding bisphosphonates to myeloma treatment reduces fractures of the vertebra (bones in the spine) and bone pain","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: It is about a retrospective survey with a receding of 40 months, achieved through 45 files of patients having benefited all of this new treatment for painful bony metastases in relation with a prostatic adenocarcinoma and collected by three centers of Nuclear Medicine of the capital: the institute Salah Azaiez (state-controlled), the Center CERU (deprives) and the Military hospital (HMPIT). RESULTS: We tried to appreciate essentially four parameters: the therapeutic efficiency, the factors influencing the answer in the treatment, the toxicity of the treatment and the sources of failure. We observed a positive answer in 92,1% of the cases, this answer was complete in 36,5% of the cases. The results gotten after multiple administrations show that the cures could be repeated with results comparable to those of the first cure. The therapeutic efficiency is at least equivalent to those of the other therapeutic means, with nearly non-existent secondary effects. The only toxicity is of hematological order; it is the most often moderate and reversible with a complete recuperation at the end of 8 weeks. Besides, the effect on the pain came with an improvement of the quality of life of the patients treaties. CONCLUSION: Its precocious introduction in the taken in charge of the metastatic patients, would allow them to benefit better from its efficiency, simplicity and weak toxicity and therefore to enjoy a better quality of life","","","","","","","Service de Medecine Nucleaire, Institut Salah Azaiez, Tunis","PM:18064991","","","",""

Although bone lesions are osteoblastic in radiographic appearance, recent evidence has demonstrated that anti-osteoclast therapy with bisphosphonates reduces skeletal-related complications in hormone-refractory prostate cancer. This observation may be explained by the demonstration that osteoclast activity is greatly upregulated even in osteoblastic metastases. Furthermore, androgen deprivation therapy, the mainstay of treatment for advanced prostate cancer, leads to increased bone resorption and reduces bone mineral density. These effects can be ameliorated, and potentially completely prevented, by coadministration of bisphosphonates. These findings may point to a role for bisphosphonates in men with prostate cancer even prior to the development of skeletal metastases. Determination of whether such early therapy ultimately results in delayed time to skeletal progression or in improved survival will require large randomized studies","","","","","","","Department of Hematology/Oncology, Massachusetts General Hospital, 100 Blossom Street, Cox 640, Boston, MA 02114, USA. d michaelson1@partners.org","PM:12667423","","","",""

Complications of bone metastases include pain, fractures, and spinal cord compression. Although they appear osteoblastic by radiographic imaging, most bone metastases are characterized by excess osteoclast number and activity. In addition, pathologic osteoclast activation is associated with increased risk of skeletal complications. Zoledronic acid, a potent inhibitor of osteoclast activity, differentiation, and survival, decreases the risk of s keletal complications in men with androgen-independent prostate cancer and bone metastases. Other bisphosphonates, including pamidronate and clodronate, seem to be ineffective in this setting. The reduction in risk of skeletal complications with zoledronic acid must be weighed against potential adverse effects. Additional studies are needed to determine the optimal timing, schedule, and duration of treatment in men with bone metastases as well as the potential role of bisphosphonates in other settings including the prevention of bone metastases.

Bone metastases account for most of the morbidity from this disease. Inhibition of osteoclast activity with the potent bisphosphonate zoledronic acid reduces skeletal complications and decreases serum levels of biochemical bone turnover markers compared with placebo. Atrasentan is an investigational agent that inhibits endothelin-1 receptor, resulting in decreased osteoblast activity. METHODS: The effects of atrasentan alone versus combination therapy with atrasentan and zoledronic acid were investigated on bone turnover markers in men with bone metastases from prostate cancer. Forty-four men were randomized to receive either atrasentan alone or combination therapy, and 33 completed at least 12 weeks of treatment and were included in the primary analysis. RESULTS: Treatment with the combination resulted in significantly lower serum levels of N-telopeptide, a marker of bone resorption, compared with treatment with atrasentan alone. There was no difference between groups in serum levels of bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, a marker of bone formation, at 12 weeks. Commonly observed adverse effects were edema, rhinitis, fatigue, and shortness of breath, most of which were NCI CTC (version 3.0) Grade 1. No Grade 4 or 5 treatment-related toxicities were observed. There was minimal clinical efficacy, with no objective responses and only 1 prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response. CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence for additive or synergistic effects of combination therapy with atrasentan and zoledronic acid on bone turnover markers in men with metastatic prostate cancer","","","","","","10.1002/cncr.22043 [doi]","Department of Hematology/Oncology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts 02114, USA. dmichaelson1@partners.org","PM:16804927","","","",""

We aimed to assess whether periodontal disease or tooth loss is associated with cancer risk. METHODS: The analysis was done in a prospective study (the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study [HPFS]), which was initiated in 1986 when US male health professionals aged 40-75 years responded to questionnaires posted by the Department of Nutrition, Harvard University School of Public Health, Boston, MA, USA. In addition to the baseline questionnaires, follow-up questionnaires were posted to all living participants every 2 years and dietary questionnaires every 4 years. At baseline, participants were asked whether they had a history of periodontal disease with bone loss. Participants also reported number of natural teeth at baseline and any tooth loss during the previous 2 years was reported on the follow-up questionnaires. Smoking status and history of smoking were obtained at baseline and in all subsequent questionnaires. Additionally at baseline, participants reported their mean frequency of food intake over the previous year on a 131-item semiquantitative food-frequency questionnaire. Participants reported any new cancer diagnosis on the follow-up questionnaires. Endpoints for this study were risk of total cancer and individual cancers with more than 100 cases. Multivariate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs were calculated by use of Cox proportional hazard models according to periodontal disease status and number of teeth at baseline. FINDINGS: In the main analyses, 48 375 men with median follow-up of 17.7 years (1986 to Jan 31, 2004) were eligible after excluding participants diagnosed with cancer before 1986 (other than non-melanoma skin cancer, n=2076) and those with missing data on periodontal disease (n=1078). 5720 incident cancer cases were documented (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer and non-aggressive prostate cancer). The five most common cancers were colorectal (n=1043), melanoma of the skin (n=698), lung (n=678), bladder (n=543), and advanced prostate (n=541). After adjusting for known risk factors, including detailed smoking history and dietary factors, participants with a history of periodontal disease had an increased risk of total cancer (HR 1.14 [95% CI 1.07-1.22]) compared with those with no history of periodontal disease. By cancer site, significant associations for those with a history of periodontal disease were noted for lung (1.36 [1.15-1.60]), kidney (1.49 [1.12-1.97]), pancreas (1.54 [1.16-2.04]; findings previously published), and haematological cancers (1.30 [1.11-1.53]). Fewer teeth at baseline (0-16) was associated with an increase in risk of lung cancer (1.70 [1.37-2.11]) for those with 0-16 teeth versus those with 25-32 teeth. In never-smokers, periodontal disease was associated with significant increases in total (1.21 [1.06-1.39]) and haematological cancers (1.35 [1.01-1.81]). By contrast, no association was noted for lung cancer (0.96 [0.46-1.98]). INTERPRETATION: Periodontal disease was associated with a small, but significant, increase in overall cancer risk, which persisted in never-smokers. The associations recorded for lung cancer are probably because of residual confounding by smoking. The increased risks noted for haematological, kidney, and pancreatic cancers need confirmation, but suggest that periodontal disease might be a marker of a susceptible immune system or might directly affect cancer risk","","","","","","S1470-2045(08)70106-2 [pii];10.1016/S1470-2045(08)70106-2 [doi]","Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, Imperial College London, London, UK. d.michaud@imperial.ac.uk","PM:18462995","","","",""

The management of this disease is replete with controversy. In men with advanced, metastatic prostate cancer, hormone therapy is almost universally accepted as the initial treatment of choice and produces good responses in most patients. However, many patients will relapse and become resistant to further hormone manipulation; the outlook for these patients is poor. Many have disease extending to the skeleton, which is associated with severe pain. Therapies for these men include chemotherapy, bisphosphonates, palliative radiotherapy, and radioisotopes. Systemic chemotherapy has been evaluated in men with hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC) for many years, with disappointing results. However, more recent studies with newer agents have shown encouraging results. There is therefore a need to explore the value of chemotherapy in this disease. OBJECTIVES: The present review aims to assess the role of chemotherapy in men with metastatic HRPC. The major outcome was overall survival. Secondary objectives include the effect of chemotherapy on pain relief, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response, quality of life, and treatment-related toxicity. SEARCH STRATEGY: Trials were identified by searching electronic databases, such as MEDLINE, and handsearching of relevant journals and conference proceedings. There was no restriction of language or location. SELECTION CRITERIA: Only published randomised trials of chemotherapy in HRPC patients were eligible for inclusion in this review. Randomised comparisons of different chemotherapeutic regimens, chemotherapy versus best standard of care or placebo, were relevant to this review. Randomised, dose-escalation studies were not included in this review. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data extraction tables were designed specifically for this review to aid data collection. Data from relevant studies were extracted and included information on trial design, participants, and outcomes. Trial quality was also assessed using a scoring system for randomisation, blinding, and description of patient withdrawal. MAIN RESULTS: Out of 107 randomised trials of chemotherapy in advanced prostate cancer identified by the search strategy, 47 were included in this review and represented 6929 patients with HRPC. Only two trials compared the same chemotherapeutic interventions and therefore a meta-analysis was considered inappropriate. The quality of some trials was poor because of poor reporting, low-patient recruitment, or poor trial design. For clarity, trials were categorised according to the major drug used, but this was not a definitive grouping, since many trials used several agents and would be eligible for inclusion in a number of categories. Drug categories included estramustine, 5-fluorouracil, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, mitoxantrone, and docetaxel. Only studies using docetaxel reported a significant improvement in overall survival compared to best standard of care, although the increase was small (< 2.5 months). The mean percentage of patients achieving at least a 50% reduction in PSA compared to baseline was as follows: estramustine 48%; 5-fluorouracil 20%; doxorubicin 50% (one study only); mitoxantrone 33%; and docetaxel 52%. Pain relief was reported in 35% to 76% of patients receiving either single agents or combination regimens. A three weekly regime of docetaxel significantly improved pain relief compared to mitoxantrone plus prednisone (the latter regimen approved as standard therapy for HRPC in the USA). All chemotherapeutics, either as single agents or in combination, were associated with toxicity; the major ones being myelosuppression, gastrointestinal toxicity, cardiac toxicity, neuropathy, and alopecia. Quality of life was significantly improved with docetaxel compared to mitoxantrone plus prednisone. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Patients with HRPC have not traditionally been offered chemotherapy as a routine treatment because of treatment-related toxicity and poor responses. Recent data from randomised studies, in particular those using docetaxel, have provided encouraging improvements in overall survival, palliation of symptoms, and improvements in quality of life.

The aim of the study was to evaluate overall and prostate cancer (PCa) specific survival with special attention to cardiovascular (CV) mortality in patients primarily treated by parenteral polyestradiol phosphate (PEP) 240 mg/month or with orchiectomy (OE), taking into account the effect of pretreatment diseases and medication, and later PCa therapies. METHODS. The present Finnprostate 6 study (10-year follow-up) consisted of 244 patients with locally advanced PCa (T3-4 M0) and 200 patients with metastatic PCa (T1-4 M1). Patients were randomized to OE or PEP therapy. The T3-4 M0 and T1-4 M1 patients were analyzed separately. RESULTS. There was no difference in overall or PCa specific survival between the primary therapy groups in T3-4 M0 or T1-4 M1 patients. In the T3-4 M0 patients the primary treatment (PEP vs. OE) was statistically significantly associated with a risk of CV deaths (P = 0.001). Such an association was not found in the T1-4 M1 patients. CONCLUSIONS. The primary PEP and OE therapies are equal in terms of overall and PCa specific survival in patients with T3-4 M0 or T1-4 M1 disease. In T3-4 M0 patients PEP increases the risk of CV deaths compared to OE but not in T1-4 M1 patients. (c) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc","","","","","","","","","","","",""

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The present study comprised 200 Finnprostate 6 study patients, but data on all variables were not known for every patient. The patients were divided into three prognostic risk groups (Rgs) using the prognostically best set of pretreatment variables. The best set was found by backward stepwise selection and the effect of every excluded variable on the binary classification cut-off points of the remaining variables was checked and corrected when needed. RESULTS: The best group of variables was ALP, PSA, ESR and age. All data were known in 142 patients. Patients were given one risk point each for ALP > 180 U/l (normal value 60-275 U/l), PSA > 35 microg/l, ESR > 80 mm/h and age < 60 years. Three risk groups were formed: Rg-a (0-1 risk points), Rg-b (2 risk points) and Rg-c (3-4 risk points). The risk of death from PCa increased statistically significantly with advancing prognostic group. CONCLUSION: Patients with metastatic PCa can be divided into three statistically significantly different prognostic risk groups for PCa-specific mortality by using the binary classified pretreatment variables ALP, PSA, ESR and age","","","","","","910563525 [pii];10.1080/00365590902836500 [doi]","Department of Urology, Helsinki University Central Hospital, Helsinki, Finland. arto.mikkola@hus.fi","PM:19382005","","","",""

New, effective treatments have emerged from a better understanding of the physiopathology of bone metastases. Objective: To summarise current insights and future perspectives in the therapy of PCa-induced bone disease. Evidence acquisition: This manuscript is based on presentations given at a satellite symposium held at the 2nd World Congress on Controversies in Urology (CURy) in Lisbon, Portugal. Data were retrieved from original and recent review papers on PCa-induced bone disease. Evidence synthesis: In normal, healthy bone, there is a balance between bone r esorption and bone formation through the coordinated activity of osteoclasts and osteoblasts. The receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand (RANKL) is an essential mediator of osteoclast formation, function, and survival. The RANKL pathway represents a therapeutic target for osteoclast-induced bone destruction in pathologic conditions, including treatment-induced bone loss and metastatic cancer. Based on a multicentre, randomised, open-label, active-controlled phase 2 trial, denosumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody against RANKL, reduced the incidence of skeletal morbidity in patients with bone metastases from PCa, breast cancer, or other neoplasms. Conclusions: In a phase 2 clinical study, denosumab reduced skeletal-related events in patients with bone metastases from PCa. In addition, the potential role of denosumab in the management of treatment-induced bone loss and the prevention of bone metastases is currently under investigation.

Patients were randomly assigned to receive either ketoconazole alone, or ketoconazole with weekly doxorubicin. All patients received replacement hydrocortisone. The primary endpoints were response and survival. Based on PSA reduction criteria (>/= 80% maintained for at least 8 weeks), 14 of 45 patients (31%) in the single-agent ketoconazole arm responded. Sixteen of 44 patients (36%) in the combination ketoconazole/doxorubicin arm responded. There were no important differences between the two treatments in any outcome measure. The median overall survival for all patients was 12.5 months; median time to progression was 3.3 months. Toxicity was significant with both regimens, and more severe in the doxorubicin arm. Fully 20% of patients in each arm discontinued therapy due to intolerable side effects.Each of these regimens is toxic, and produced responses in fewer than half of treated patients. Although the observed median survival does compare favorably with reports from similar cohorts treated in the community, the potential benefit is only modest. In our view, neither of these regimens is sufficiently promising to justify phase 3 evaluation","","","","","","S107814390000123X [pii]","Center for Genitourinary Oncology, Department of Genitourinary Medical Oncology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA","PM:11344001","","","",""

METHODS: Two different formulations of triptorelin pamoate 11.25 mg were assessed in 2 groups of 10 patients suffering from prostatic carcinoma. Each patient received one i.m. injection of triptorelin pamoate SR 11.25 mg. Triptorelin and testosterone levels were measured over 3 months. Pain, micturition difficulties, performance status, local and general tolerance, and the occurrence of adverse events were evaluated. RESULTS: Both formulations were able to induce castration levels (<1.735 nmol/l) of testosterone within 3 to 4 weeks post-injection, and to maintain levels below 1.735 nmol/l till the end of 3rd month. The bioavailability of one formulation (DLGSD-3-95-21) tended to be greater. This may explain the quicker onset of castration and the slight better maintenance of low testosterone levels during the 3rd month observed with this formulation. In terms of clinical end-points, the local tolerance of both formulations was excellent. No serious adverse events were recorded except transient hot flushes in 2 cases and slight bone pain in one. CONCLUSION: Triptorelin pamoate 11.25 mg given in microgranules is a 3-month sustained-release administration form which appears to be safe and effective in advanced prostatic carcinoma. Based on the findings of this study, the formulation with greater bioavailability (DLGSD-3-95-21) was selected as formulation of choice to be used for clinical treatments and further clinical investigation","","","","","","","Section of Urology, Scientific Institute N.

Whereas, to the best of our knowledge, only few cases of bone metastases from tumors other than prostate and breast treated with [186Re]HEDP have been reported. The aim of this paper is to report our experience with 186Re-HEDP in the palliation of painful bone metastases from tumors other than prostate and breast. METHODS: In this study 41 patients (17 non-small cell lung cancer-NSCLC, 1 small cell lung cancer, 1 lung neuroendocrine tumor, 8 bladder cancer, 3 kidney cancer, 3 gastric cancer, 1 uterine carcinoma, 1 colon cancer, 1 rhinopharynx carcinoma, 1 medullary thyroid carcinoma, 1 ovarian cancer, 1 esophagus cancer, 2 carcinoma of unknown origin) are evaluated. All patients had lesions with increased [99mTc]MDP uptake and none had radiological findings of mainly osteolytic lesions. A total of 46 therapeutic cycles were performed using a [186Re]HEDP activity of 1 295 MBq for each administration. After treatment, patients were followed up for 3 months or to the time of pain recurrence (if longer than 3 months). Responses were evaluated using a validated method considering the modifications of pain index, analgesic intake and performance status. RESULTS: Treatment efficacy was complete in 49% (20/41) of patients, partial in 36% (15/41) and negative in 15% (6/41). Namely, we observed 35% (6/17) complete, 41% (7/17) partial and 24% (4/17) negative responses in patients with NSCLC and 63% (5/8) complete, 25% (2/8) partial and 12% (1/8) negative responses in patients affected by bladder cancer. The median duration of pain relief in responder patients was 10 weeks. A mild platelet toxicity occurred in 32% (13/41) of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Pain palliation with [186Re]HEDP seems highly effective and safe also in patients with bone metastases from cancers other than prostate and breast. Patients who can benefit from the treatment with [186Re]HEDP can be selected on the basis of [99mTc]MDP bone scan and radiological examination findings","","","","","","","Nuclear Medicine Unit, Department of Radiological Sciences, University of Messina, Messina, Italy","PM:17043634","","","",""

RECENT FINDINGS: The beneficial role of prostatectomy has been affirmed in several studies examining its therapeutic impact in locally advanced, nonmetastatic prostate cancer. Adjuvant therapy with radiation or hormones appears to increase prostate-specific antigen relapse-free survival. Whether prostate-specific antigen relapse-free survival is an appropriate surrogate for overall survival remains unverified. The timing and duration of hormonal therapy continues to be debated. Hormone therapy administered 'too late' in the course of metastatic disease portends a shortened survival but possible side effects of androgen ablation must be considered. Several docetaxel-based combination chemotherapies for hormone refractory prostate cancer are being studied, but their efficacy in the neoadjuvant setting thus far has been limited. Progress in the palliation of bony metastases has resulted in a decrease in symptoms and skeletal events. SUMMARY: This review identifies seminal data that focus on controversial therapeutic dilemmas in prostate cancer. The literature of the last few years universally emphasizes the importance of a multidisciplinary collaboration in prostate cancer. It is only with this type of cooperation that essential research will continue and succeed. (c) 2008 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Bisphosphonates interfere with bone remodeling at the sites of PrCa bone metastases and have been postulated to have indirect and/or direct anti-PrCa activity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted to compare a combination of somatostatin analog (octreotide 20 mg i.m. every 28 days) and oral dexamethasone (4 mg daily for 1 month, gradually reduced to 1 mg daily by the fourth month, with a 1 mg daily maintenance dose thereafter) plus zoledronate (4 mg i.v. every 4 weeks) vs. zoledronate only. All patients in both arms remained in basic androgen blockade throughout the study. RESULTS: Thirty-eight stage D3 patients (mean age 72.8 +/- 6.8 years) were randomized to either treatment arm of the study. The trial was stopped after a pre-specified interim analysis met the criteria for early closure, i.e. significant difference in outcomes between the two treatment arms. Partial responses (PR, > or =50% PSA decline) were observed in 13 out of 20 patients with combination therapy vs. none with zoledronate. The combination therapy arm had significantly better outcome with respect to median progression-free survival (7.0 vs. 1.0 months, p < 0.0001), median overall survival (OS) (12.0 vs. 9.0 months, p = 0.0027), median PrCa-specific OS (defined as time from onset of therapy until PrCa-related death) (16 vs. 9.0 months, p = 0.0005) and median duration of bone pain improvement (>14 vs. 4 months p = 0.00001 by log-rank tests). CONCLUSION: For androgen ablation-refractory metastatic PrCa patients under androgen ablation, the combination of dexamethasone, somatostatin analog and zoledronate offered superior objective and palliative clinical responses than zoledronate alone","","","","","","","Department of Experimental Physiology, Medical School, University of Athens, Goudi-Athens, Attiki 115 27, Greece","PM:17094387","","","",""

Despite initial sensitivity to hormone treatment, prostate cancer eventually progresses to a castration-resistant stage (CRPC), which carries an ominous prognosis. Lanreotide is a long-acting somatostatin analog with the same properties with the native peptide. It has been shown to be highly efficacious in treating various hypersecretoty disorders and tumors. Lanreotide has been administered to patients with CRPC within a novel treatment concept, with the aim of targeting not only cancer cells but also various factors secreted in the tumor cell milieu that confer protection from apoptosis. Within this concept, lanreotide has been administered as part of the 'antisurvival factor therapy' in combination with dexamethasone and a gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) analog. It has also been given combined with oestrogens in patients with CRPC. The so far published series have documented a clinical response in many patients treated along with significant improvement in parameters related to quality of life. In view of these promising results, large-scale, randomized, controlled trials are warranted to clearly define the exact role of lanreotide and other somatostatin analogs in the treatment of patients with CRPC","","","","","","10.1517/14656560802694689 [doi];10.1517/14656560802694689 [pii]","University of Athens, School of Medicine, 2nd Department of Urology, 5 Proussis Street, 14232 Nea Ionia, Athens, Greece. imitsog@med.uoa.gr","PM:19191684","","","",""

METHODS: From April 2004 through August 2008, we used docetaxel plus prednisolone to treat 55 HRPC patients (median age, 72 years). Eighteen patients (32.7%) had measurable soft tissue lesions, whereas 52 patients (94.5%) had bone metastases. During the 21-day treatment cycle, docetaxel (70 mg/m(2)) was administered once every 21 days and oral prednisolone (5 mg), twice daily. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response, defined as a reduction of at least 50% in the baseline levels for 4 weeks, was evaluated. RESULTS: The median follow-up period was 30.1 months; median overall survival, 15.3 months and median progression-free survival, 7.5 months. During follow-up, 37 patients (67.3%) achieved the PSA response, and 5 of 18 (27.8%) patients with measurable disease showed a partial response. Among the 27 patients who experienced cancer pain before treatment initiation, 15 (55.5%) reduced their analgesic drug intake. Multivariate analysis of the prognostic variables revealed a significant association between the overall survival and pain (P = 0.033). Hematological toxicity (grades 3-4) included neutropenia (87.3%), febrile neutropenia (25.5%) and thrombocytopenia (5.5%). Frequent non-hematological adverse events were general edema (52.7%), general fatigue (32.7%) and sensory neuropathy (30.9%). Three patients died of adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). CONCLUSION: Docetaxel plus prednisolone treatment is effective in Japanese HRPC patients. The main toxicity is neutropenia, which can be safely controlled by outpatient treatment with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor. However, the Japanese patients in our study developed ARDS more frequently than other patients in previous studies did","","","","","","hyq100 [pii];10.1093/jjco/hyq100 [doi]","Department of Urology, National Hospital Organization Shikoku Cancer Center, Matsuyama, Japan. nmiura@m.ehime-u.ac.jp","PM:20587613","","","",""

The objective of this study was to retrospectively evaluate the clinical outcome of the oral anticancer agent, uracil/tegafur (UFT) for patients with hormone refractory prostate cancer. This study included 68 patients with hormone refractory prostate cancer treated by oral administration of UFT (300-600 mg/day). All patients had previously received maximum androgen blockade (MAB) which failed. In this series, response was defined as more than 50% decrease from the baseline prostate specific antigen (PSA) value at the start of second line therapy. Upon initiating administration of UFT, a reduction in PSA value was observed in 41 of the 68 patients (60.3%), among whom 13 (19.1%) were regarded as responders; however, PSA value continued to increase in the remaining 27 (39.7%). Median duration of PSA response was 7 months (range 1-22 months). During the observation period, there were no severe side effects due to UFT administration, but 7 patients transiently presented appetite loss. Patients without bone metastasis at the initial diagnosis or whose serum PSA value at the start of UFT therapy was less than 2.0 ng/ml showed a significantly higher incidence of PSA response to UFT; however, other factors examined had no significant impact on PSA response to UFT. Furthermore, cause-specific survival in responders to UFT therapy was significantly better than that in non-responders. These findings suggest that administration of UFT after the failure of initial MAB therapy can achieve a comparatively favorable PSA response without severe side effects; therefore, it may be worthy to consider administering UFT to patients with hormone refractory prostate cancer","","","","","","","Department of Urology, Hyogo Medical Center for Adults, 13-70 Kitaohji-cho, Akashi 673-8558, Japan. hideakimiyake@hotmail.com","PM:16077973","","","",""

Once housed in the skeleton, tumors are incurable and cause protracted morbidity, and bone metastases may contribute to mortality through unknown mechanisms. Bone provides a unique microenvironment whose local interactions with tumor cells offer novel targets for therapeutic interventions. Many standard cancer treatments cause bone loss, which may aggravate skeletal metastases, although this is preventable with approved agents. Improved bone-targeted treatments can decrease the serious skeletal morbidities associated with metastatic prostate cancer and may in the future improve overall survival. The development of such treatments requires preclinical evaluation in animal models of prostate cancer growth in bone. (c) 2009 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd","","","","","","","","","","","",""

No definition of biochemical failure exists that can be applied to all forms of treatment and that is not to some degree affected by the follow-up interval, pretreatment prognostic factors, or the frequency of prostatic-specific antigen (PSA) testing. Available imaging techniques lack sensitivity in detection of occult micrometastases. Prognostic factors such as tumor characteristics and PSA kinetics should be considered when recommending second-line therapies. For those patients with suspected localized recurrence, second-line treatment with sal vage therapies may provide long-term disease control. Hormonal therapy, although most commonly employed for PSA recurrence, is of palliative benefit only. Currently, the most appropriate therapeutic intervention for asymptomatic patients with evidence of biochemical failure remains undefined.

An attempt was made to recapitulate the observations in a clinical trial. METHODS: Twenty-nine patients with progressive, metastatic, chemotherapy-naive androgen-independent prostate cancer were treated with diethylstilbestrol 1 mg daily and 5 mg on the day before docetaxel and docetaxel 36 mg/m(2) intravenously weekly for 3 weeks of a 4-week cycle. Prophylactic anticoagulation was used in all patients. Patients were assessed by prostate-specific antigen (PSA) monthly and computed tomography (CT) and bone scans every 3 cycles. The Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria and PSA decline by >50% maintained for 4 weeks were used to assess activity. RESULTS: The median age was 68 years (range, 56-84 years), Southwest Oncology Group performance status 0 (score range, 0-2), alkaline phosphatase 120 U/L (range, 49-523), hemoglobin (Hgb) 12.6 g/dL (range, 9.2-16.3), PSA 66 ng/dL (range, 4-1962). The median number of cycles administered was 6. Soft tissue metastases were present in 51% of patients and bone metastases in 93%. Twenty-nine patients are evaluable for response. Of these, 20 patients (69%, 95% confidence interval [CI], 49%-85%) had a PSA decline of >50% and the PSA declined by >90% in 12 patients (41%, 95% CI, 23.1%-58.9%). Of 15 patients with measurable disease, 6 (40%, 95% CI, 23.5%-61%) had a partial response. Median time to progression was 6 months (range, 3-19 months). Fifteen patients (51%) suffered grade 3/4 toxicity. Two patients died of causes unrelated to therapy and another died from a steroid-induced ulcer. Six patients developed thrombosis and of those tested 75% had Factor V mutations. Pretreatment PSA, performance status, Hgb, and alkaline phosphatase had no impact on the likelihood of response. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of diethylstilbestrol and docetaxel produces a significant level of activity, measured by PSA decline and measurable disease response rate, and except for venous thrombosis the toxicity appears similar to that seen with docetaxel plus prednisone. These results suggest that tubulin modulation with diethylstilbestrol may improve the therapeutic efficacy of docetaxel and the combination is worthy of further study","","","","","","10.1002/cncr.22917 [doi]","Department of Medicine, Veterans Affairs Puget Sound Health Care System (VAPSHCS), and University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA 98108, USA. rbmontgo@u.washington.edu","PM:17639587","","","",""

The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and tolerability of fenretinide in chemotherapy-naive men with hormone refractory prostate cancer. Methods: Eligibility criteria included hormone refractory prostate cancer with a rising PSA at least 6 weeks after peripheral anti-androgen withdrawal, ECOG performance status (PS) 0-1, and no prior chemotherapy. Fenretinide was administered orally at 900 mg m SUP -2 twice daily for 7 of every 21 days. PSA was measured before each cycle. The primary endpoint was a <=50% reduction in PSA maintained for at least 3 weeks; secondary endpoints included duration of PSA response, time to treatment fai lure (TTF: treatment stopped for progression or toxicity) and adverse events (AE). Results: Twenty seven pts were recruited from 7 centres over 27 months. Median age was 74 (range 49-86), median baseline PSA was 129 (range 19-1,000), and 70% had a PS of 0. The median number of cycles received was 2 (range 0-11) and 20 pts completed at least 1 cycle. One pt (4%) achieved a 50% reduction in PSA lasting 39 days and 15 pts (56%) had not progressed within 6 weeks of starting fenretinide. The median TTF was 54 days (IQR 19-73): 22 (81%) failed with tumour progression, 3 (11%) failed with toxicity and 2 (7%) never commenced the drug. Grade 3 rash occurred in 1 patient, all other AE were grade 1 or 2. The most common AE were nausea (40%), hot flushes (36%), constipation (32%) and nyctalopia (32%).

Neridronate, a relatively new bisphosphonate, is able to prevent bone loss in patients with prostate cancer during androgen ablation. INTRODUCTION: Androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) is a cornerstone of treatment for advanced prostate cancer. This therapy has iatrogenic complications, such as osteoporosis. The aim of our study was to evaluate the efficacy of neridronate, a relatively new bisphosphonate, to prevent bone loss during androgen ablation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-eight osteoporotic patients with prostate cancer, treated with 3-month depot triptorelina, were enrolled and randomly assigned to two different treatment groups: group A (n = 24) was treated with a daily calcium and cholecalciferol supplement (500 mg of elemental calcium and 400 IU cholecalciferol), and group B (n = 24) received in addition to the same daily calcium and cholecalciferol supplement, 25 mg of neridronate given intramuscularly every month. All patients also received bicalutamide for 4 weeks. Lumbar and femoral BMD was evaluated by DXA at baseline and after 1 year of therapy; moreover, deoxypyridinoline (DPD) and bone alkaline phosphatase (BALP) were determined at the beginning, midway through, and at the end of the study. RESULTS: After 6 and 12 months, whereas patients treated only with calcium and cholecalciferol (group A) showed a marked bone loss, with increased levels of DPD and BALP compared with baseline values, patients treated also with neridronate (group B) had substantially unchanged levels of these markers. After 1 year of treatment, lumbar and total hip BMD decreased significantly in patients treated only with calcium and cholecalciferol (group A), whereas it did not change significantly at any skeletal site in patients treated also with neridronate (group B). No relevant side effects were recorded during our study. CONCLUSIONS: Neridronate is an effective treatment in preventing bone loss in the hip and lumbar spine in men receiving ADT for prostate cancer","","","","","","10.1359/JBMR.040813 [doi]","Department of Internal Medicine, University of Messina, Messina, Italy. nancynat@libero.it","PM:15476575","","","",""

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Inclusion criteria were proven tumor progression after hormonal treatment and increased PSA levels, a WHO PS < or = 2, adequate bone marrow reserve, liver and renal function and age < or =, 80 years. Response criteria were based on PSA levels (CR: normalization of PSA, PR: > 50% decrease). Quality of life (QL) was assessed with the EORTC QLQ-C30 on day 1 of each treatment cycle and on day 8 of the first cycle (range of scales 0-100). Physician-rated pain intensity and use of pain medication were assessed at the same timepoints. RESULTS: Hematological toxicity of gemcitabine led to a dose-reduction in 48% of all cycles. Three of forty-three patients (RR = 7%) showed a PSA response: one CR and three PR with time to treatment failure of 8.7, 6.6 and > or = 9.3 months. Seven patients (16%) had stable disease (NC) for a median duration of 7.1 months (range 6.1-11.7 months). There was one case with objective regression of lymph node metastases. Patients reported a considerably impaired health status/QL (n = 41, median = 50) and severe fatigue (n = 41, median = 55.6) at baseline, with no change under treatment. Pain (QLQ-C30) was also severe at baseline (N=41, median=50) but was improved at the end of cycles 1 (n = 33, median change = -16.7, P = 0.0002), 2 (n = 19, median change = -33.3, P = 0.0006), 3 (n = 14, median change = -16.7, P = 0.06) and 4 (n = 9, median change = -33.3, P = 0.04). Patient-rated pain and use of analgesics as combined endpoint yielded palliation for at least 8 weeks in 14 patients (32%). Nine of these patients showed at least stable disease (CR/PR or NC by PSA level), five indicated a benefit in spite of progressive disease. CONCLUSIONS: Gemcitabine in the dose and schedule indicated above has a significant beneficial impact on pain in patients with hormone-refractory prostatic carcinoma despite its limited activity in terms of PSA response and considerable, especially hematological, toxicity","","","","","","","","PM:10761753","","","",""

In all, 25 patients with HRPC were enrolled on a phase II trial of capecitabine (Xeloda) at a dose of 1250 mg m(-2) orally twice daily on days 1-14 every 21 days. The inclusion criteria were PSA serum levels >3 x upper limit of normal, a WHO performance status 0-2, age <85 years and adequate bone marrow, liver and renal function. In patients with grade 2 or higher haematological toxicity on day 1 of the treatment cycle, therapy was first delayed, and then continued at a lower dose. Trial end points were PSA response and clinical benefit defined by quality of life (QL) data and analgesic consumption. The median age of patients was 70 years (range 54-85 years). A median of three cycles of capecitabine was administered (range 1-8). PSA response was observed in three patients (12%, 95% CI 3-31%), with times to tumour progression of 18, 21 and 35 weeks, respectively. In these patients, the response durations were 12, 17 and 32 weeks, respectively. Minor PSA regression was also seen in two further patients. The median time to tumour progression of all patients was 12 weeks (95% CI 9-15 weeks). Haematological toxicity was minor, with leukopenia grade 3 observed in one patient. There were three deaths during trial treatment, respectively, due to sepsis following mucositis and leukopenia, presumed sepsis with mucositis induced by chemotherapy and concomitant radiotherapy and cerebral dysfunction progressing to coma. Hand-foot syndrome grades 2 and 3 were observed in four patients each. Clinical benefit was observed in five patients (20%, CI 7-41%). Based on toxicity data, we recommend a lower starting dose of 1000 mg x m(-2) orally twice daily. While capecitabine has some activity in HRPC, as suggested by observed PSA responses, we conclude that it is not worthwhile to investigate capecitabine monotherapy in a phase III trial.

Early testing in animal models and humans provided insight into the potential clinical uses of these substances, and, within 10 years, LHRH-agonist therapy had become available for use in patients with advanced prostate cancer (PC). Over time, the role of LHRH-agonist therapy has expanded to include use as part of multimodal treatment regimens throughout the course of the disease. OBJECTIVES: This article reviews the discovery and development of LHRH agonists and summarizes the clinical evidence for their efficacy in PC. METHODS: Relevant clinical studies were identified through searches of the English-language literature indexed on MEDLINE through May 2006. The main search terms were prostate cancer and LHRH agonist. RESULTS: Results of the initial therapeutic trials of sustained-release depot formulations of LHRH agonists in patients with PC were reported in the mid-1980s, indicating that these agents were effective and well tolerated in improving clinical symptoms and producing medical castration. Longer-term studies and subsequent meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials in patients with advanced PC found no significant differences in overall survival when single-therapy androgen suppression was achieved through the use of LHRH-agonist therapy or orchiectomy. Randomized trials have reported significant improvements in disease-free and overall survival in patients with locally advanced or high-grade PC treated with LHRH agonists in addition to radiotherapy. Several prospective randomized trials have reported decreases in rates of positive surgical margins with short-term (6 weeks to 4 months) neoadjuvant LHRH-agonist therapy in patients with stage T1 to T3a PC undergoing prostatectomy. Definitive comparisons of immediate and delayed treatment in patients with biochemical relapse have not been reported. However, the results of several studies suggest that immediate LHRH-agonist therapy (or orchiectomy) may improve the course of disease progression and survival. The risks of long-term treatment (eg, osteoporosis; fracture; anabolic loss of muscle mass, with a tendency toward weight gain) must be considered carefully in patients who are likely to receive chronic LHRH-agonist therapy. Intermittent schedules have been developed to reduce the adverse effects associated with LHRH-agonist therapy; some reports support sparing effects on bone and muscle mass and relative improvements in toxicities during off-therapy periods, whereas others have documented continuing decreases in bone mineral density (BMD), with the rate of bone loss highest during the early cycles of therapy. Bisphosphonate therapy has been shown to increase BMD in patients with PC and may therefore be beneficial when overt symptoms of osteopenia or osteoporosis are present. CONCLUSIONS: LHRH-agonist therapy has been the mainstay of treatment for advanced PC for >20 years. Clinical evidence supports expanding use of these agents at an earlier stage of disease and as part of multimodal regimens that include radiotherapy. There is a need for further study of the efficacy of adjuvant LHRH-agonist therapy along with prostatectomy, in patients with biochemical failure, in intermittent regimens, and in conjunction with cytotoxic therapies in late-stage disease","","","","","","S0149-2918(06)00258-X [pii];10.1016/j.clinthera.2006.10.018 [doi]","Ipsen Research and Development, Milford, Massachusetts, USA","PM:17157109","","","",""

Zoledronic acid is widely accepted as the treatment of choice for a number of cancers which metastasise to bone and is the only bisphosphonate licensed for the treatment of prostate cancer. However, drug related nephrotoxicity, although rare, does pose a significant complication when using zoledronic acid. Prostate cancer patients are generally older than 65 years of age and already exhibit some form of impaired renal function. Thus, for prostate cancer patients who are unable to tolerate zoledronic acid there is a need for an alternative bisphosphonate. One possibility could be ibandronate which is also a potent third generation, nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate and is an attractive choice for some patients due to the fact it is available in both intravenous and oral preparations. Methods. This article reviews the current published literature regarding the use of ibandronate in the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer. Results. Preliminary data emerging from small Phase II studies suggests ibandronate may provide a therapeutic alternative for the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer when zoledronic acid is deemed unsuitable. Conclusion. Further in vivo research with ibandronate in prostate cancer is urgently needed in order to elucidate whether this bisphosphonate may play a role in the treatment and palliative management of metastatic prostate cancer.

More recently, an emerging body of preclinical and clinical evidence indicates that bisphosphonates might also exhibit antitumor activity. This expanded role for bisphosphonates in the adjuvant setting might have profound clinical implications in many cancer types, particularly in the context of prevention of bone metastasis. Increased understanding of the mechanistic basis of the antitumor effects indicates that these might occur via direct mechanisms such as induction of apoptosis and inhibition of tumor cell adhesion and invasion, as well as indirect mechanisms such as inhibition of angiogenesis. There is also considerable evidence to suggest that nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates might exert additive or synergistic interactions with standard cytotoxic agents. However, mature clinical data with bisphosphonates are limited and, thus far, provide conflicting evidence regarding the antitumor role of bisphosphonates, but have mostly been conducted with first-generation bisphosphonates such as clodronate that are not as effective as next-generation bisphosphonates. Several large randomized clinical trials are ongoing with the next-generation bisphosphonate zoledronic acid to prospectively confirm an antitumor role for bisphosphonates in various tumor types.

Arguments used to support this concern lack a scientific basis. The original assertion by Huggins that administration of testosterone (T) caused 'enhanced growth' of PCa was based on only a single patient. New evidence suggests that TRT has little, if any, negative impact on the prostate, even in men with a history of PCa. A saturation model is proposed that is consistent with regression of cancer when T is reduced to castrate levels and with lack of observed growth when serum T is increased. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

To know the influence of the modality and the length of androgen ablation on the prevalence of osteoporosis. To analyze the relative risk of hip fracture. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, we assessed bone densitometry at the Ward's triangle of the femoral neck in 110 patients with non-metastatic prostate cancer and without biochemical relapse. A cohort of 53 patients under continuous androgen suppression during a median period of 41 months (12-191) formed the study group and 57 age-matched patients that had been submitted to a radical prostatectomy formed a control group. RESULTS: Both subsets of patients had similar mean age (70.4 vs. 69.2, p=0.07). Mean bone mass was 0.70 g/cm2 in patients under androgen suppression and 0.76 g/cm2 in the control group, p=0.06. The rate of osteoporosis was 41.5% (22/53) and 28.1% (16/57) respectively, p=0.16 and the odds ratio was 1.82 (95% CI 0,82-4.03). The rate of osteoporosis was 41.4% (12/29) in patients under maximal androgen blockade and 41.7% (10/24) in patients under chemical castration, p=0.735. According to the length of the androgen suppression the rate of osteoporosis was 36.4% when it was between 12 and 36 months, 42.1% from 36 to 60 months and 50% when it was longer than 60 months. While the overall relative risk of hip fracture in the control group was 2.0, it was 2.4 when the length of androgen suppression was between 12 and 36 months, 2.9 between 36 and 60 months and 3.9 when it was longer than 60 months. CONCLUSIONS: Androgen suppression increases the prevalence of osteoporosis in patients with prostate cancer. The modality of continues androgen suppression seems not to affect its prevalence. However the length of androgen suppression would be related to its development. The relative risk of hip fracture is also increasing during the androgen suppression","","","","","","S0302283803003798 [pii]","Department of Urology, Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Po Vall d'Hebron 119-129, 08035 Barcelona, Spain. morote@hg.vhebron.es","PM:14644117","","","",""

Hormonal therapy and chemotherapy alone cannot eradicate disease harbored in bone. The delivery of radiotherapy to the reservoir of disease is an approach previously only achievable using bone-seeking radiopharmaceuticals. Now, however, with the identification of tumor-specific targets, antibodies are being used to deliver radiotherapy to these sites. In this article, we review the rationale behind this approach, the targets being explored , the radiation sources available, and the antibodies currently under clinical development.

The overall QoL is reduced in asymptomatic men, and there are known decreases in cognitive function, self-esteem, libido and sexual function. Hot flashes are also a frequent problem. Prolonged ADT can lead to osteoporosis and subsequently fractures. Various effective methods exist to manage and minimize these side-effects; some are specific to the side-effect, whereas other more general methods include lifestyle changes, specific drugs and added hormonal manipulations. Intermittent ADT for patients taking luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists offers a promising method to reduce adverse effects, and possibly increases the time to androgen independence. Initial studies indicate that prostate-specific antigen-based progression with intermittent ADT is similar to that seen with continuous ADT, but there is a reduction in side-effects, leading to an improvement in QoL.

METHODS: The working panel performed a literature review of the new data emerging from 2007 to 2010. The guidelines were updated, and the levels of evidence (LEs) and/or grades of recommendation (GR) were added to the text based on a systematic review of the literature, which included a search of online databases and bibliographic reviews. RESULTS: Luteinising hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists are the standard of care in metastatic prostate cancer (PCa). Although LHRH antagonists decrease testosterone without any testosterone surge, their clinical benefit remains to be determined. Complete androgen blockade has a small survival benefit of about 5%. Intermittent androgen deprivation (IAD) results in equivalent oncologic efficacy when compared with continuous androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) in well-selected populations. In locally advanced and metastatic PCa, early ADT does not result in a significant survival advantage when compared with delayed ADT. Relapse after local therapy is defined by prostate-specific antigen (PSA) values >0.2 ng/ml following radical prostatectomy (RP) and >2 ng/ml above the nadir after radiation therapy (RT). Therapy for PSA relapse after RP includes salvage RT at PSA levels <0.5 ng/ml and salvage RP or cryosurgical ablation of the prostate in radiation failures. Endorectal magnetic resonance imaging and (11)C-choline positron emission tomography/computed tomography (CT) are of limited importance if the PSA is <2.5 ng/ml; bone scans and CT can be omitted unless PSA is >20 ng/ml. Follow-up after ADT should include screening for the metabolic syndrome and an analysis of PSA and testosterone levels. Treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) includes second-line hormonal therapy, novel agents, and chemotherapy with docetaxel at 75 mg/m(2) every 3 wk. Cabazitaxel as a second-line therapy for relapse after docetaxel might become a future option. Zoledronic acid and denusomab can be used in men with CRPC and osseous metastases to prevent skeletal-related complications. CONCLUSION: The knowledge in the field of advanced, metastatic, and CRPC is rapidly changing. These EAU guidelines on PCa summarise the most recent findings and put them into clinical practice.

We examined whether microvessel morphology contributes to the considerable biologic heterogeneity of prostate cancer. METHODS: We evaluated microvessel morphology as a predictor of prostate cancer mortality among 572 men in the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study diagnosed with cancer during 1986 to 2000. We immunostained prostatectomy tumor block sections for endothelial marker CD34 and assessed microvessel density, vessel size (area and diameter), and irregularity of vessel lumen using image analysis. Proportional hazards models were used to assess microvessel density and morphology in relation to lethal prostate cancer. RESULTS: Poorly differentiated tumors exhibited greater microvessel density, greater irregularity of the vessel lumen, and smaller vessels. During 20 years of follow-up, 44 men developed bone metastases or died of cancer. Men with tumors exhibiting the smallest vessel diameter, based on quartiles, were 6.0 times more likely (95% CI, 1.8 to 20.0) to develop lethal prostate cancer. Men with the most irregularly shaped vessels were 17.1 times more likely (95% CI, 2.3 to 128) to develop lethal disease. Adjusting for Gleason grade and prostate-specific antigen levels did not qualitatively change the results. Microvessel density was not linked to cancer-specific mortality after adjusting for clinical factors. CONCLUSION: Aggressive tumors form vessels that are primitive in morphology and function, with consequences for metastases. Vascular size and irregularity reflect the angiogenic potential of prostate cancer and may serve as biomarkers to predict prostate cancer mortality several years after diagnosis","","","","","","JCO.2008.20.8876 [pii];10.1200/JCO.2008.20.8876 [doi]","Channing Laboratory, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA. lmucci@hsph.harvard.edu","PM:19858401","","","",""

However, it is also known to be associated with considerable surgery-related trauma. The purpose of this study was to show that lumbar corpectomy and anterior reconstruction can be performed via a minimally invasive retroperitoneal approach (MIRA) and therefore the surgical approach-related trauma can be reduced. The authors studied retrospectively the hospital records and radiological studies obtained in five patients (mean age 67.4 years, range 59-76 years) who underwent lumbar corpectomy and spinal fusion via an MIRA followed by posterior fixation. Four patients presented with osteoporotic compression fractures at L-2 and L-3, and one patient presented with metastatic disease in L-4 from prostate cancer. Neurological deficits due to cauda equina compression were demonstrated in all patients. The MIRA provided excellent exposure to facilitate complete decompression and anterior reconstruction in all patients, as verified on follow-up radiographic studies. All patients improved clinically. A 1-year follow-up record is available for four patients and a 6-month follow-up record for the fifth patient; continuing clinical improvement has been observed in all. Radiography demonstrated anatomically correct reconstruction in all patients, as well as a solid fusion or a stable compound union in the four patients for whom 1-year follow-up records were available. The MIRA allows the surgeon to perform anterior lumbar spine surgery via a less invasive approach. The efficacy and safety of this technique and its potential to reduce perioperative morbidity compared with conventional retroperitoneal lumbar spine surgery should be further investigated in a larger series","","","","","","","Department of Neurosurgery, Donauspital SMZ-Ost, Vienna, Austria. ma.muhlbauer@netway.at","PM:10879777","","","",""

We reviewed the patients in terms of their prognostic factors and survival. The patients without advanced diseases were diagnosed as having prostate carcinoma, using either biopsies or transurethral resection of the prostate. The carcinomas were categorized into localized prostate carcinomas (stage A, B or C) as a result of digital rectal examinations, computed tomography scans and bone scans. The patients were informed of the risk of surgery and, if they agreed to sign the consent form, underwent radical prostatectomy under general and epidural anesthesia usually 2 months after a positive biopsy. The surgical specimens were sent for pathology and were graded according to classifications of well-, moderately and poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. The patients were usually discharged from the hospital 2-3 weeks postoperatively and had regular follow-up treatment. The mean age (+/- SD) was 68.75 (+/- 5.59) years and the mean follow-up period was 47.2 months. There was a significant difference (34.4%) in pathologic grades between biopsy and surgical specimen. In a quarter of the patients (approximately 26.4%) upgrading of the surgical report occurred despite neoadjuvant therapy. Three-year, 5-year and 7-year actuarial survival rates were 91.8%, 79.9% and 71.9%, respectively.

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels have been used as a screening tool and a biomarker of response to both hormonal and cytotoxic agents. However, PSA levels do not seem to be a suitable surrogate end point for OS in trials of targeted agents for castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). These findings suggest the need for adopting measures of efficacy that more accurately reflect the mechanisms of action of these agents in phase II trials, in order to realize improvements in OS in the phase III setting. The Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group (PCWG2) have recently made recommendations for the design of future trials and advised that PSA levels should not be the sole criterion on which to base clinical decisions. Here, we appraise the end points that have been used in phase II and III trials in patients with CRPC, and highlight the need for the adoption of the PCWG2 guidelines, the recommendations of which include radiographic imaging, in addition to bone scintigraphy, and symptomatic or radiographic disease progression criteria","","","","","","pcan200925 [pii];10.1038/pcan.2009.25 [doi]","Department of Urology, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Center, Postbus, Nijmegen, The Netherlands. p.mulders@uro.umcn.nl","PM:19597531","","","",""

METHODS: DCs + PSMA peptides in patients undergoing leukapheresis were administered monthly 1-4 times, at rates greater than 20 million DCs in 17 patients not previously treated, and in 11 patients previously treated. RESULTS: Three partial responders and one complete responder were noted in the 17 previously untreated persons. DCs + PSMA peptides averaged 28.5 million cells (range in millions, 21.0-42.3). All responders received 3 or 4 infusions of greater than 22 million cells (3-4 times). In the previously treated group of 11 patients, DCs infused averaged 29.3 million cells (range in millions, 20-40.5). One new responder (bone scan) was noted. Two prior responders continued. Observation times were similar. Toxicity was minimal. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that DCs + PSMA peptide infusions can be given with greater numbers of DCs with a lesser number of infusions (1-4 monthly) with no loss of response rates compared to those noted previously, and without increased side effects.

This retrospective study was done to evaluate the ability of the (111)Indium-labeled monoclonal antibody (ProstaScint(R)) scan in detection of prostatic bed recurrence and/or metastases to regional and/or distant lymph nodes. METHODS: One hundred sequential patients were evaluated with repeated ProstaScint(R) scans because of evidence of recurrence during the course of their disease. These 100 patients were followed closely from November 1994 and April 1999, and had concurrent bone scans and serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) evaluations. They have had hormone therapy (n = 53) and/or experienced a rising PSA after radical prostatectomy (n = 38) or after radiation therapy (n = 56). Scan images were scored 0-3, where score 0 = negative, score 1= prostate bed uptake, score 2 = regional lymph node uptake, and score 3 = distant lymph node uptake. In each patient, the uptake of the follow-up scan(s) was compared to that of the initial scan. RESULTS: The median age was 70 years (range, 45-87), and 23 patients had a positive bone scan. The average PSA was 40.5 ng/ml (standard deviation, 223.5). There was 257 scans representing 100 patients. All patients had at least 2 scans, 35 patients had 3 scans, and 11 patients had 4 scans. No individual exhibited detectable adverse clinical reactions during or after the scan. The findings of the initial and consecutive scans were anatomically consistent in 79%, whereas in 21% there were skip metastases. In 24 patients the lesions progressed by scan and PSA, 10 patients showed progression of scan but no PSA progression, 49 patients showed no change, and 17 patients showed a remission related to adjuvant therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The consistency on repeating the scan (79%) and the high percentage of patients showing persistent uptake at the prostate bed (43%) as well as the percentage of detection of regional nodes (20%) and distant nodes (32%) reflects the importance of using the ProstaScint(R) scan in finding occult recurrences after primary treatment failure of prostate cancer. These results are similar to those reported earlier in autopsy series studies in similar populations","","","","","","10.1002/(SICI)1097-0045(20000301)42:4<315::AID-PROS9>3.0.CO;2-S [pii]","Pacific Northwest Cancer Foundation, Seattle, Washington, USA","PM:10679761","","","",""

Traditional statistical analysis as well as artificial neural network (ANN) analysis were employed to evaluate individual patients and the group as a whole. The results were evaluated so that each factor was tested for prognostic value. METHODS: Data obtained from serum tests, bone scans, and ProstaScint scans were evaluated by traditional statistical methods and ANN to determine the individual value in clinical staging of prostate cancer. RESULTS: Two hundred seventy-five patients (180 postprostatectomy, 95 intact prostate) with prostate cancer (14 with distant metastases) were available for analysis. Data available included: clinical state (remission or progression), most recent clinical TNM stage, bone scan, and ProstaScint scan. Serum was tested for prostate-specific membrane antigen(PSMA), prostate-specific antigen(PSA), free PSA (fPSA), and complexed PSA (cPSA). Additional calculations included percent free PSA, and percent complexed PSA. Spearman individual statistical assessment for traditional group evaluation revealed no significant factors for T-stage. The free PSA and complex PSA had a significant association with node (N)-status. The distant metastases (M) stage correlated well with the bone scan and clinical stage. ANN analysis revealed no significant T-stage factors. N-stage factors showed a 95% sensitivity and 49% specificity. These factors included the presence or absence of a prostate, PSA serum levels, bone scan, and ProstaScint scans as major associated indicators. ANN analysis of the important variables for M-stage included ProstaScint scan score, and PSA levels (total, percent complexed, percent free, and fPSA). These factors were associated with a 95% sensitivity and 15% specificity level. CONCLUSIONS: Two hundred seventy-five patients receiving treatment for prostate cancer were evaluated by ANN and traditional statistical analysis for factors related to stage of disease. ANN revealed that PSA levels, determined by a variety of ways, ProstaScint scan, and bone scan, were significant variables that had prognostic value in determining the likelihood of nodal disease, or distant disease in prostate cancer patients","","","","","","10.1002/(SICI)1097-0045(20000201)42:2<145::AID-PROS9>3.0.CO;2-Q [pii]","Pacific Northwest Cancer Foundation, Seattle, Washington 98125, USA. gmurph@pncf.org","PM:10617872","","","",""

Here we simultaneously profiled key components of this axis to determine their relevance in disease progression. An optimized immunohistochemistry protocol was used in expression analysis of FGF2, FGF8, FGFR1, FGFR4, and Sef (similar expression to FGF) in a single TMA of prostate cancer. FGF ligands and receptors were overexpressed in cancers compared to benign samples (p < 0.0001), while Sef expression was reduced (p < 0.0001). There was a positive association between higher grades and increased FGFR4 (p = 0.02), FGF2, and FGF8 (p = 0.002 and p < 0.0001). Sef expression was progressively lower with increasing grade (p = 0.005). Clinical stage was positively associated with FGF2, FGF8, and FGFR4 expression (p = 0.005, 0.03, and 0.012) but not with FGFR1 or Sef expression. Only reduced Sef was associated with bone metastasis (p = 0.02) and was also predictive of subsequent metastasis in initially localized tumours (p = 0.004). Down-regulation of Sef and increased FGFR4 were also the only independent variables associated with disease-specific survival (HR 1.73, p = 0.04 and HR 0.56, p = 0.01). In in vitro studies, silencing Sef enhanced the cell response to FGFs (p < 0.001) and substantially mitigated the effectiveness of an FGFR1 inhibitor. Conversely, increased Sef blocked the response to FGFs and had a comparable suppressive effect to the inhibitor. This study demonstrates that increased FGFR4 and reduced Sef may be critical FGF alterations associated with prostate cancer progression. Sef may also have a role in the tumour response to FGFR inhibition and warrants further investigation in this context","","","","","","10.1002/path.2657 [doi]","Translational Prostate Cancer Group, Hutchison MRC Research Centre, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, CB2 0QQ, UK","PM:19960500","","","",""

Patients were classified into those in remission, those with stable disease, or those with progressive disease according to their prostate-specific antigen response and their clinical status. Thirty-four percent of all patients had PTH levels above the upper level of normal for controls of similar age (7.0 pmol/liter), and in 44% of these patients this was associated with a normal ionized calcium. Patients with proven bone metastases had significantly higher PTH levels than those without. (7.3 +/- 0.5 vs. 4.3 +/- 0.4 pmol/liter, P < 0.0005). There was evidence for a difference in the PTH levels between the three response groups. The PTH levels tended to be higher in patients with progressive disease. Thirty-seven of 65 patients (57%) with both progressive disease and proven bone metastases had elevated PTH levels. Mean levels of urinary deoxypyridinoline and cAMP were significantly greater in patients with high PTH than in those with a normal PTH. Treatment with oral calcium supplements in 32 patients with a high PTH seemed to have only a transient effect on elevated PTH or low ionized calcium levels. These data show that secondary hyperparathyroidism occurs frequently in patients with advanced prostate cancer, particularly in those with both progressive disease and bone metastases. The increased PTH levels are associated with an increase in bone resorption markers. These findings raise important questions about the role of PTH in progression of prostatic cancer in bone and the potential limitations of the use of bisphosphonates in patients with a raised PTH or low serum calcium","","","","","","","Peter MacCallum Cancer Institute, Melbourne 3002, Australia","PM:11549639","","","",""

As this phenomenon has not been addressed by any studies in the literature and because these positive PLNs had the potential to be mistakenly diagnosed as metastatic RA, we were prompted to undertake a retrospective study of rectal resections for RA to determine the frequency of PCA metastasizing to the PLNs in this patient population. The laboratory information system of the Department of Pathology, Capital Health, Halifax, Nova Scotia was searched for lymph node (LN)-positive RAs resected by low anterior resection or APR in male patients between January 1, 1992 and December 31, 2002. The hematoxylin and eosin slides were retrieved and reviewed, comparing the histology of the primary rectal tumor with that of the LN metastases in each case. Metastases having a different histologic appearance than the primary rectal tumor or having a pattern suggesti ve of metastatic PCA were analyzed by immunohistochemistry to detect prostate specific antigen (PSA), prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP), cytokeratin 7 (CK7), cytokeratin 20 (CK20), and carcinoembryonic antigen in LN metastases and in each RA. The presence or absence of mucin in the tumors was assessed by staining with Alcian blue, periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) +/- diastase, and modified PANFOPAS (2-hydroxy-3-naphthoic acid hydrazide/fast black B/sapo nification/periodic acid-Schiff). The study identified 112 cases of RA with positive LNs. Of those, 5 of 112 (4.5%) were identified as having metastatic PCA within the PLNs. All five were positive for PSA and PAP and only one case had rare CK20-positive tumor cells. The primary RAs were all diffusely positive for CK20 and carcinoembryonic antigen. Two cases of metastatic PCA expressed colonic type/acetylsialomucin, which was also seen in well-differentiated primary RAs. These 5 patients had a mean age of 76.8 years (range, 68-82 years). Four (80%) underwent APR while one (20%) underwent a low anterior resection. The mean number of LNs identified per case was 14 (range, 5-26). The mean number of LNs per case with metastatic PCA was 7.6 (range, 1-18). The majority of the LNs were under 1.0 cm in diameter. Two cases (40%) were associated with significant extranodal extension of PCA. The PLNs were mistakenly diagnosed as being involved by RA 40% of the time. On follow-up, 2 patients (40%) had died with progressive pelvic tumor, while 3 patients (60%) were alive, including 2 who, as a result of the study, were referred to the urology service for management. Both of these patients were subsequently started on medical (anti-androgen) therapy and 1 additionally had bilateral orchiectomy. In 4 of the patients, the serum PSA after the rectal resection ranged from 2.5 to 13.5 ng/mL. In 1 patient, the serum PSA was markedly elevated (5961 ng/mL), and this patient was subsequently identified on bone scan as having extensive skeletal metastases. This study identified a subset (4.5%) of patients with RA and PLNs positive for PCA. PCA may extend to the PLN basin and therefore influence the management of patients with rectal tumors and the staging, LN dissection, and management of patients with PCA. Moreover, the LNs were incorrectly diagnosed as metastatic RA 40% of the time, emphasizing the need to consider the differential diagnosis of metastatic PCA when evaluating PLNs. The diagnosis of metastatic PCA can be confirmed using an immunohistochemical panel consisting of PSA, PAP, CK20, and carcinoembryonic antigen along with mucin stains in some cases. In patients undergoing APR for RA, there should be preoperative screening for PCA as it will not be possible to do a digital rectal examination or transrectal ultrasound post-APR, and a prostate biopsy, if necessary, would have to be done via the more difficult transperineal approach","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in men in the UK, and the incidence of prostate cancer has increased dramatically over the past two decades. Although most men are diagnosed at early stage, more than 50% develop locally advanced or metastatic disease. Androgen ablation with luteinising hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists alone, or in combination with anti-androgens, is the standard treatment for men with metastatic prostate cancer. Unfortunately, almost all men develop progressive disease after a variable time period, despite the maximal androgen blockade. The management of hormone refractory prostate cancer (HRPC) is challenging, as there is no uniformly accepted strategy. Various treatment options, including second-line hormone therapy, are discussed. Chemotherapy is being increasingly used and, importantly, docetaxel and estramustine may play an important role in the near future. The role of radiotherapy, strontium-89, bisphosphonates, novel agents and future therapies are also outlined. (c) 2004 The Royal College of Radiologists. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

METHODS: Fifty-eight patients were referred for evaluation of a rising PSA level after radical prostatectomy. All patients had negative findings for metastatic disease after abdominal/pelvis imaging with CT and isotope bone scans. All patients underwent a capromab pendetide scan, and the sites of uptake were noted. All patients were treated with local prostate bed RT (median dose 66.6 Gy). RESULTS: Of the 58 patients, 20 had biochemical failure (post-RT PSA level >0.2 ng/mL or a rise to greater than the nadir PSA), including 6 patients with positive uptake outside the bed (positive elsewhere). The 4-year biochemical relapse-free survival (bRFS) rates for patients with negative (53%), positive in the prostate bed alone (45%), or positive elsewhere (74%) scan findings did not differ significantly (p = 0.51). The positive predictive value of the capromab pendetide scan in detecting disease outside the bed was 27%. The capromab pendetide scan status had no effect on bRFS. Those with a pre-RT PSA level of <1 ng/mL had improved bRFS (p = 0.003). CONCLUSION: The capromab pendetide scan has a low positive predictive value in patients with positive elsewhere uptake and the 4-year bRFS was similar to that for those who did not exhibit positive elsewhere uptake. Therefore, patients with a postprostatectomy rising PSA level should considered for local RT on the basis of clinicopathologic factors","","","","","","S0360-3016(06)02993-2 [pii];10.1016/j.ijrobp.2006.09.026 [doi]","Department of Radiation Oncology, Loyola University Medical Center, Maywood, IL 60153, USA. snagda@gmail.com","PM:17293236","","","",""

This study was undertaken to assess the feasibility of docetaxel in combination with prednisolone in Japanese patients with HRPC. Methods: Patients aged 50-74 years with measurable metastatic HRPC were included in this non-comparative Phase II study. Treatment consisted of docetaxel 70 mg/m SUP 2 once every 3 weeks plus prednisolone 5 mg twice daily, for a maximum of 10 cycles. The primary endpoint was overall tumor response rate, assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors; secondary endpoints included prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response and toxicity. Results: A total of 43 patients were evaluable for efficacy and toxicity. The response rate was 44.2% (90% CI, 31.2-57.8%), with partial responses in 19/43 patients. The median duration of response was 19.3 weeks. PSA responses were recorded in 44.4% of patients (95% CI, 27.9-61.9%). The most common no n-hematological adverse events (of any grade) possibly related to treatment were alopecia (88.4%), anorexia (65.1%) and fatigue (53.5%). Grade 3/4 leukopenia and neutropenia occurred in 81.4 and 93.0% of patients, respectively; however, the grade 3/4 rates of febrile neutropenia (16.3%) and infection without fever (14.0%) were lower. Conclusion: The combination of docetaxel and prednisolone was feasible and active in Japanese patients with HRPC, with a manageable adverse-event profile similar to that observed in Western patients.

Definitive local treatments such as radical prostatectomy and external beam radiotherapy cure only a minority of these patients. Recent efforts have been made to reduce the risk of recurrence and delay progression to symptomatic hormone-refractory disease by using chemotherapy before, during, or after definitive local therapy. Chemotherapy is an effective modality in the treatment of hormone-refractory prostate cancer. Studies have established its role in the palliation of symptoms in patients with hormone-refractory disease, though a survival benefit remains to be d emonstrated. Prospective randomized trials are underway to test the hypothesis that neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy may improve survival rate in patients with high-risk localized prostate cancer. The data currently available from nonrandomized trials have not yet established the exact role of neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy and its potential impact on survival. However, preliminary data suggest that chemotherapy, when administered in concert with definitive local therapy, may be promising in patients with locally advanced prostate cancer. Randomized clinical trials are ongoing to s ee if neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy will translate into an improved clinical benefit for the patient, and participation by patients is paramount. We review the recent literature regarding the use of neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced prostate cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: WB-MRI was performed on 16 patients for detecting bone metastasis (6 breast carcinoma, 7 prostatic carcinoma, 1 renal cell carcinoma [RCC], 1 hepatocellular carcinoma [HCC], and 1 primary unknown). BS was also performed in all cases. Patients were placed on a table top extender (Philips Medical Systems). The maximal longitudinal field of view (FOV) was 200 cm. At first, the total spine was imaged in the sagittal plane with a three-station approach for two image sets (fast spin-echo [SE] T1-weighted images [T1WI] and short tau inversion recovery [STIR] images). The whole body was then imaged in the coronal plane with a seven-station approach for two image sets (fast field echo [FFE] T1WI and STIR). Total examination time, including patient positioning, was within 40 min. Three independent radiologists interpreted the imaging data. RESULTS: WB-MRI identified 5 cases of 24 lesions as bone metastasis, while BS identified 3 cases of 25 lesions. Concordance between WB-MRI and BS was seen in 3 cases of 22 lesions (81%). For two cases of 2 lesions, which were identified only with WB-MRI, the lesions were located in the sacrum and thoracic spine. For one case of 3 lesions, which was identified only with BS, the lesions were located in the skull and rib.

Patients and Methods: 412 patients with metastatic prostate cancer diagnosed after January 1995, with at least 6 months of follow-up, were enrolled. Serum PSA was determined at diagnosis and every 3-6 months thereafter. All patients underwent medical or surgical castration. End points of the study were either death or disease progression. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard analysis was used to evaluate prognostic factors. Results: Median progression-free and overall survival was 3 and 5.7 years. Pat ients aged <=65 years at diagnosis, high baseline PSA and high nadir PSA were associated with poor overall survival. Patients with a PSAT SUB 1/2 of <6 months, high baseline alkaline phosphatase, and PSADT of <1 month had significantly poorer progression-free and overall survival. Conclusion: Prostate cancer is a common malignancy in the elderly population. We have found that younger patients with high baseline and nadir PSA, shorter PSADT and PSAT SUB 1/2 have poorer overall and progression-free survival. Copyright (c) 2010 S.

There are currently no clear recommendations for the use of single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/CT in metastatic bone disease. Given its limited availability there is a need to identify the clinical indications for which SPECT/CT is clearly beneficial in influencing patient care and outcome. METHODS: Forty-two patients with equivocal lesions on planar scintigraphy were recruited and underwent SPECT/CT imaging. On reading of SPECT alone and then SPECT/CT, lesions were classified as malignant, benign or equivocal. Follow-up clinical information, radiological studies and/or bone scans were used as a gold standard. SPECT and SPECT/CT were compared in terms of the number of equivocal findings and accuracy on a patient-wise and lesion-wise basis. RESULTS: Forty-two patients with 189 skeletal lesions were examined. There was a diverse variety of primary tumours, with the majority being breast (n=22) and prostate cancer (n=8). SPECT/CT resulted in a significant reduction in the proportion of patients (48-14%, P=0.0015) and lesions (31-9%, P<0.0001) with equivocal findings. The overall accuracy of SPECT/CT was significantly higher on both a patient-wise (52-79%, P=0.0026) and lesion-wise basis (67-92%, P<0.0001). CONCLUSION: SPECT/CT significantly outperforms SPECT alone for the interpretation of skeletal lesions in patients undergoing bone scanning for metastases. When available SPECT/CT is indicated in patients in whom correct classification of equivocal lesions is expected to alter the patient's management","","","","","","10.1097/MNM.0b013e3283399107 [doi]","Department of Nuclear Medicine, Stellenbosch University, Cape Town, South Africa. ndlovu.x@gmail.com","PM:20395878","","","",""

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In all, 72 patients with metastatic HRPC were randomly assigned to receive docetaxel (70 mg/m(2) intravenously, on day 2 every 21 days) and estramustine (3 x 280 mg/day oral starting 1 day before docetaxel, for 5 consecutive days) for arm A, or estramustine (3 x 140 mg/day oral starting 1 day before docetaxel, for 3 consecutive days) for arm B. Premedication with oral dexamethasone at a total daily dose of 16 mg, in divided doses twice a day was administered in arm A on day 1-5 and in arm B on day 1-3. Initially, six cycles were administered. Chemotherapy was restarted after a significant increase in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level. Patients were monitored for any measurable PSA response and toxicity. RESULTS: Between the arms there was no statistically significant difference in time to progression and overall survival. However, treatment B had less treatment-related toxicity than A. Independent prognostic variables were baseline factors like PSA level, haemoglobin level, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, and bone pain at presentation. CONCLUSIONS: In this randomized phase II study the combination of docetaxel and estramustine had substantial activity in HRPC, with a significant incidence of severe toxicity, both haematological and not. Nevertheless, treatment-related toxicity was predictable and manageable. There was no better effect with a higher dose of estramustine with docetaxel than for a lower dose. There was a slight tendency to higher toxicity for high-dose estramustine but this was not statistically significant. The present results support the assertion that estramustine is not necessary in docetaxel-based treatment regimens","","","","","","BJU6324 [pii];10.1111/j.1464-410X.2006.06324.x [doi]","Department of Urology, Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg, Leipziger Str. 44, D-39120 Magdeburg, Germany. thomas.nelius@medizin.uni-magdeburg.de","PM:16925757","","","",""

In this study, we evaluate the efficacy of cyclophosphamide (CP)-based metronomic chemotherapy in this patient population. Patients with metastatic HRPC with disease progression under docetaxel-based chemotherapy were eligible. The primary endpoint was prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response. Secondary endpoints were survival and toxicity. Low-dose CP (50 mg/d) and dexamethasone (1 mg/d) were administered orally in a metronomic manner. Treatment was continued until disease progression or intolerable side effects occurred. Seventeen patients were enrolled in this study. The median follow-up was 12 weeks (range: 4-60). Median age was 68 years (range: 42-85). Median PSA at study entry was 134 ng/ml (range: 46.0-6554). Nine patients had a PSA response (median 44.4%), four patients >or=50% and five patients <50%. Eight patients had a PSA progression. Overall survival was 24 months. Five patients reported a decrease in bone pain after 4 weeks' treatment. No grade 3 and 4 toxicities were noted. In this study, low-dose metronomically administered CP demonstrated efficacy as a second-line treatment in patients with docetaxel-resistant HRPC. The treatment was well tolerated and almost without toxicity. Further advantages of low-dose CP were its convenient oral administration, dosing schedule, low cost, and low-toxicity profile. These attributes in combination with immunoregulatory and antiangiogenic potentials make CP also a prime candidate for combination with other treatment regimens","","","","","","10.1007/s12032-009-9218-8 [doi]","Department of Urology, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, 3601 4th Street, Stop 7260, Lubbock, TX 79430-7260, USA. thomas.nelius@ttuhsc.edu","PM:19365737","","","",""

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled clinical trial of hormone refractory prostate cancer patients was done at 74 medical centers in the United States and Europe. A total of 288 asymptomatic patients with hormone refractory prostate adenocarcinoma and evidence of metastatic disease were randomized to 1 of 3 treatment groups, namely 2.5 mg. atrasentan, 10 mg. atrasentan or placebo administered orally daily until disease progression. The main outcomes measures were changes in bone deposition markers (total alkaline phosphatase and bone alkaline phosphatase) and bone resorption (N-telopeptides, C-telopeptides and deoxypyridinoline), and in the bone scan index. RESULTS: At baseline markers of bone deposition and resorption were elevated 1.4 to 2.7-fold above respective upper limits of normal. Subjects receiving placebo experienced a 58% elevation in mean total alkaline phosphatase and a 99% elevation in mean bone alkaline phosphatase (p < 0.001), whereas subjects receiving 10 mg. atrasentan maintained stable mean total alkaline phosphatase and bone alkaline phosphatase values compared with baseline. N-telopeptides, C-telopeptides and deoxypyridinoline elevation from baseline were consistently less in patients receiving 10 mg. atrasentan compared with placebo. Similar trends were observed in subjects who received 2.5 mg. atrasentan. Changes in clinical bone scan studies paralleled bone marker changes. CONCLUSIONS: Atrasentan suppressed markers of biochemical and clinical prostate cancer progression in bone and demonstrates clinical activity for hormone refractory prostate cancer","","","","","","10.1097/01.ju.0000042162.08938.27 [doi];S0022-5347(05)63915-8 [pii]","Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA","PM:12576870","","","",""

progression, thus requiring a re-evaluation of treatment strategy. Treatment alternatives for men with hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC) have been limited to palliative care in the absence of a survival advantage associated with chemotherapy. In 2004, docetaxel-based chemotherapeutic regimens, now the standard for HRPC, were shown to confer a significant survival advantage in 2 large, randomized, controlled phase III trials. Bone-targeted therapies, specifically endothelin-A receptor antagonists (eg, atrasentan), bone-targeted radiopharmaceuticals, and bisphosphonates (eg, zoledronic acid), directly address the bone-stromal interactions underlying painful bone metastases. Atrasentan potentially reduces the incidence of and delays time to the onset of bone pain, may delay time to disease progression, and may improve the quality of life in patients with HRPC. Zoledronic acid was shown, in a phase III trial, to decrease the incidence of skeletal-related events and prolong the time to a first skeletal-related event in men with HRPC. Bone-targeted radiopharmaceuticals have been shown in phase III trials to decrease bone pain and decrease opioid utilization in patients with bony metastatic disease. Clinical trials are in progress to identify novel agents, in addition to optimize the combination of chemotherapeutic, bone-targeted agents and immunologic approaches. A wide variety of novel approaches, including immunologic therapies, are being tested","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this article, the authors report the results from a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of atrasentan in patients with nonmetastatic HRPC. METHODS: Of 941 patients who had adequate androgen suppression and no radiographic evidence of metastases but rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, 467 patients were randomized to receive atrasentan at a dose of 10 mg, and 474 patients were randomized to receive placebo daily. The primary endpoint was the time to disease progression (TTP), which was defined as the onset of metastases. Secondary endpoints were the time to PSA progression, change in bone alkaline phosphatase (BALP) levels, PSA doubling time, and overall survival. RESULTS: There was a 93-day delay in the median TTP with atrasentan, but the difference from placebo in TTP was not statistically significant (P= .288). Large geographic differences in the median TTP were noted: in the US: The difference was 81 days longer with placebo; whereas, in non-US sites, the difference was 180 days longer with atrasentan. Atrasentan lengthened the PSA doubling time (P= .031) and slowed the increase in BALP (P< .001). The median survival was 1477 days with atrasentan and 1403 days with placebo. The most common adverse events associated with atrasentan were peripheral edema, nasal congestion, and headache, consistent with the vasodilatory properties of ET(A) receptor antagonists. CONCLUSIONS: Although the primary endpoint was not achieved, large regional differences in TTP were noted, suggesting that trial conduct may have influenced the results. The biologic activity was consistent with findings from other clinical trials of atrasentan in HRPC","","","","","","10.1002/cncr.23864 [doi]","Department of Urology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15232, USA. nelsonjb@upmc.edu","PM:18785254","","","",""

Through an understanding of the biology of endothelin-1 (ET-1) and the endothelin receptors (the endothelin axis) in prostate cancer (PCa), this axis has emerged as a promising target for therapeutic intervention. Objectives: This review discusses the biology of the endothelin axis, several of the preclinical observations supporting the therapeutic rationale, and some of the available clinical trial data on this promising new approach. Evidence acquisition: A n onsystematic review of the literature, including PubMed and congress abstracts, was performed in 2008. Evidence synthesis: Based on the clinical trial results, the limitations and promise of the endothelin axis as a therapeutic target is discussed. Conclusions: Clinical trials of potent, selective, or specific endothelin A (ET SUB A ) receptor subtype antagonists have demonstrated clinical activity. Such agents have not yet been approved for the treatment of PCa, but the ongoing phase 3 trials will further define their efficacy for treating CRPC.

Between October 2000 and November 2002, 32 patients were enrolled in this study. Patients characteristics included a median age of 72 years (range 68-77), adequate hepatic, cardiac, renal and bone marrow functions, ECOG performance status of 1-2, and no prior chemotherapy. All patients had received hormonal manipulation and seven patients (22%) had received prior palliative radiation therapy. The regimen consisted of paclitaxel 70 mg/m2 i.v. infusion for 2 h and epirubicin 30 mg/m2 in bolus every week. Treatment was continued for 3 months or until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity were observed. During the study, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was monitored and response was defined as a 50% reduction in PSA levels, to be confirmed 4 weeks later. Thirty-one patients were evaluable for toxicity and 21 for objective response. Seventeen patients (57%) had a decline above 50% in PSA level that lasted more than 4 weeks with a median time to PSA progression and a median duration of PSA response of approximately 5.5 months. Ten of the 21 patients with measurable disease (47%) had a confirmed objective response (one complete response and 20 partial responses). Thirteen of 25 symptomatic patients (56 %) had improvement in pain. The median time to disease progression was 7.6 months and the median survival was 12.9. The most prominent grade 3 toxicities were reversible myelosuppression and fatigue. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and peripheral edema were minimal. No evidence of cardiac toxicity was recorded. Alopecia was frequent, but reversible, in all patients. We conclude that despite the small sample size, this study demonstrates that the combination of weekly paclitaxel and epirubicin is a well-tolerated regimen for androgen-independent prostate cancer. The results imply that a combination of these agents in a weekly schedule may have clinical potential in prostate cancer treatment","","","","","","00001813-200501000-00009 [pii]","Department of Internal Medicine-Experimental and Clinical Oncology Center, University of Florence, Florence, Italy. brunoneri@unifi.it","PM:15613906","","","",""

A number of placebo-controlled trials have demonstrated their positive impact on skeletal-related events (SRE) that occur as a consequence of metastatic or myelomatous bone disease. Based upon their chemical structure bisphosphonates can be classified into nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates, (N-bisphosphonates) (for example zoledronate and pamidronate) and non-nitrogen containing (for example, clodronate and etidronate), which more closely resemble PPi. Clinical trials investigating bisphosphonates in the preventative setting have shown bisphosphonates to not only delay occurrence of bone metastases in certain cancers, but in one trial, occurrence of non-osseous lesions was delayed, and survival was prolonged. Other trials however have shown the opposite. Likewise, in animal models of cancer and metastases, conflicting results have been obtained. In vitro work has concentrated on bisphosphonates direct action upon tumour cells and has found a variety of anti-tumour effects such as apoptosis induction, inhibition of cell growth, inhibition of invasive behaviour and inhibition of angiogenic factors. Furthermore it would appear that bisphosphonates have the potential to enhance anti-tumour activity of known cytotoxic drugs. Ongoing research aims to assess this further, in addition to determining more precisely the role of adjuvant bisphosphonates in cancers such as breast and prostate cancer","","","","","","S0305737202000956 [pii]","Department of Clinical Oncology, Cancer Research Centre, Sheffield, UK. h.l.nevillewebbe@sheffield.ac.uk","PM:12470981","","","",""

BPs are an established treatment for cancer that has spread to bone, and effectively reduce pain and other skeletal-related events. New directions in metastatic bone disease (MBD) include personalised BP therapy, such as using bone markers to guide frequency of BP administration and bone targeting agents such as denosumab (AMG 162). Clinical trials strongly suggest that denosumab might play a defined role in the future management of MBD. In terms of potential anti-cancer activity, early data tentatively suggest that zoledronic acid might have a role to play in the prevention of metastatic disease, though whether this is a direct effect on cancer cells, or indirect via the bone marrow micro-environment, or both, is as yet undiscovered.

One way to achieve this is to use surrogate end points for overall survival (OS). Measurement of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels is widely used in screening for prostate cancer and may be used as a biomarker of disease progression. However, although PSA may serve as a suitable prognostic biomarker, its utility as a valid surrogate end point for OS in hormone-resistant prostate cancer (HRPC) trials has been inconclusive. Evidence acquisition: The utility of PSA as a surrogate end point in HRPC is reviewed and alternative recommendations discusse d. A nonsystematic review of the literature, including PubMed and congress abstracts, was performed in 2008. Evidence synthesis: Despite being widely available and easy to measure, reductions in PSA levels have not been validated as a surrogate end point for use in clinical trials of agents with novel mechanisms of action. Conflicting data from preliminary studies of cytotoxic and molecular-targeted agents in HRPC have shown that improvements in OS are not consistently reflected by reductions in PSA. There are a number of potential reasons for this inconsistency, including heterogeneity of PSA expression with disease progression and the influence of comorbidities, including age. Although changes in PSA levels may be a suitable surrogate end point for studies of cytotoxic agents, it may have less utility in studies of targeted agents with antiproliferative or anti-invasive mechanisms of action. As questions have emerged about the utility of PSA levels as a surrogate end point, the Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group has reviewed the criteria for outcome measures in clinical trials that evaluate systemic treatment for patients with progressive prostate cancer. Recommendations note that PSA responses may be delayed in trials of noncytotoxic agents, and rising PSA levels in the absence of other signs of progression should not lead to discontinuation of trials. Conclusions: OS remains the most accurate end point for clinical trials, and changes in PSA levels may not reflect a patient's response to therapy.

There are few data evaluating the effect on pain of palliative chemotherapy. The aim of this randomized phase II study was to assess and compare the analgesic efficacy of strontium-89 and chemotherapy (FEM=5-FU, epirubicin, and mitomycin C) in 35 patients with disseminated, hormone-refractory prostate cancer suffering from persisting bone pain despite analgesic treatment. In order to minimize the risk for imbalances regarding the two patient groups, a double-blind randomization was performed. A significant reduction in pain intensity and pain frequency was registered in both patient groups (P < 0.01 in both groups after 3 weeks). Side effects were generally mild in the strontium-89 group and significantly more severe in the FEM group. The effect of FEM on pain is surprising as chemotherapy has generally only limited effect on tumor growth in bone metastases due to prostate cancer. A possible explanation is that FEM has an inhibitory activity on the inflammatory component of metastases","","","","","","S0885-3924(05)00052-7 [pii];10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2004.07.008 [doi]","Radiumhemmet, Karolinska Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden","PM:15857738","","","",""

We aimed to study mature outcomes from a randomised, multicentre, phase II study of (223)Ra. METHODS: Patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer and bone pain needing external-beam radiotherapy were assigned to four intravenous injections of (223)Ra (50 kBq/kg, 33 patients) or placebo (31 patients), given every 4 weeks. Primary endpoints were change in bone-alkaline phosphatase (ALP) concentration and time to skeletal-related events (SREs). Secondary endpoints included toxic effects, time to prostate-specific-antigen (PSA) progression, and overall survival. All tests were done at a 5% significance level, based on intention to treat. FINDINGS: Median relative change in bone-ALP during treatment was -65.6% (95% CI -69.5 to -57.7) and 9.3% (3.8-60.9) in the (223)Ra group and placebo groups, respectively (p<0.0001, Wilcoxon ranked-sums test). Hazard ratio for time to first SRE, adjusted for baseline covariates, was 1.75 (0.96-3.19, p=0.065, Cox regression). Haematological toxic effects did not differ significantly between two groups. No patient discontinued (223)Ra because of treatment toxicity. Median time to PSA progression was 26 weeks (16-39) versus 8 weeks (4-12; p=0.048) for (223)Ra versus placebo, respectively. Median overall survival was 65.3 weeks (48.7-infinity) for (223)Ra and 46.4 weeks (32.1-77.4) for placebo (p=0.066, log rank). The hazard ratio for overall survival, adjusted for baseline covariates was 2.12 (1.13-3.98, p=0.020, Cox regression). INTERPRETATION: (223)Ra was well tolerated with minimum myelotoxicity, and had a significant effect on bone-ALP concentrations. Larger clinical trials are warranted to study (223)Ra on the prevention of SREs and on overall survival in patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer. Bone-targeting properties of (223)Ra could also potentially be used for treating skeletal metastasis from other primary cancers","","","","","","S1470-2045(07)70147-X [pii];10.1016/S1470-2045(07)70147-X [doi]","Karolinska Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden","PM:17544845","","","",""

In the current study, low doses of dexamethasone were investigated for their specific beneficial effects and the feasibility of long term treatment. METHODS: Thirty-seven patients diagnosed with HRPC were treated with oral dexamethasone (0.5-2 mg/day). The patients ranged in age from 53-89 years (median, 74 years). Thirty-two patients, including 6 with lymph node metastases, had bone involvement whereas only 5 patients were found to have elevated serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients (62%) who received no other concomitant therapy demonstrated a decline in their serum PSA level of > or = 50%, which was confirmed by a second PSA value obtained > or = 4 weeks later. The median time to PSA progression was 9 months. Among 18 patients with bone pain, 11 (61%) had improvement and in 5 patients (28%) the pain became stable. Among 21 patients with interpretable bone scans, 4 (19%) showed improvement and 8 (38%) achieved stable disease. Both symptomatic and objective responses of bone metastases were correlated with declines in the serum PSA level of > or = 50%. Ten patients achieved an increase in their hemoglobin level of at least 2 g/dL. Patients whose PSA level declined by > or = 50% with therapy had significantly prolonged survival (median, 22 months). As pretreatment markers, a longer interval before the initial evidence of disease progression appeared was found to correlate significantly with posttherapy PSA declines of > or = 75%. All side effects of the glucocorticoids were reported to be mild. CONCLUSIONS: Low doses of dexamethasone were found to be beneficial in the treatment of HRPC, decreasing the severity of anemia and osseous disease as well as reducing serum PSA levels. A posttherapy serum PSA decline of > or = 50% appears to be a reliable marker of improved survival with this therapy","","","","","","10.1002/1097-0142(20001215)89:12<2570::AID-CNCR9>3.0.CO;2-H [pii]","Department of Urology, Osaka University Medical School, Suita, Japan. kazu@uro.med.osaka-u.ac.jp","PM:11135218","","","",""

Methods: We studied 50 patients who had been diagnosed with bone metastatic prostate cancer. HER-2 overexpression in the prostatic tissue by biopsy was evaluated by immunohistochemistry using the Hercep test. The results were scored into four levels by two pathologists; scores greater than 1+ were considered positive. Results: The HER-2 staining score was 0, 1+, 2+, 3+, and indeterminate in 28, 4, 11, 6, and 1 case, respectively. HER-2 was overexpressed (greater than 1+) in 21 patients (42%). The cause-specific survival and nonrecurrence rates were significantly lower in the HER-2-positive group than in the negative group (P = 0.0084 and P = 0.0485, respectively). Furthermore, the cause-specific survival rate after recurrence was significantly greater in the HER-2-negative group than in the positive group (P = 0.0247).

METHODS: Two hundred and twenty-one patients who underwent a radical prostatectomy with or without adjuvant androgen deprivation from 1989 to 1999 were selected for the study. Eighty percent of the patients received postoperative androgen deprivation. Tumor recurrence was strictly defined as detectable serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) and/or clinical findings such as local tumor detection or bone metastasis. Thirty of 221 patients experienced tumor recurrence. Risk of tumor recurrence, procedures for detection of recurrence, and PSA doubling time after biochemical failure were analyzed. RESULTS: None of the 30 patients who were examined showed definitive local recurrence or metastatic sites on the imaging study at the time of initial PSA detection, and there were no observed recurrences in the absence of detectable serum PSA. In patients who showed elevated PSA within 12 months after radical prostatectomy, PSA levels rapidly increased with doubling times ranging from 1.2 to 13.7 months. Excluding those patients, the doubling time of PSA levels ranged from 2.8 to 31.5 months. CONCLUSIONS: Prostate specific antigen screening is sufficient to detect treatment failure after radical prostatectomy, irrespective of adjuvant hormone therapy. Based on the calculated doubling time, the longest advisable interval between checks of PSA levels is estimated to be four months within the first year after radical prostatectomy, and biannually or annually thereafter. Continuously elevated PSA levels or clinical symptoms indicate surveys for local recurrences and distant metastases","","","","","","435 [pii]","Urology Division, National Cancer Center Hospital, 1-1 Tsikiji, 5 Chome, Chuo-ku, Tokyo 104-0045, Japan. mniwakaw@gan2.res.go.jp","PM:12010322","","","",""

Results. Serial ICTP and PICP levels in 48 patients without progression of bone metastasis d emonstrated a downward trend during treatment and were almost within the normal range by the end of follow-up. The remaining 36 patients, who had PSA failure with progression of bone metastasis, showed an upward trend for serial ICTP and PICP levels before the progression of bone metastasis. The rates of detecting bone progression using bone turnover markers were higher than those using PSA levels on the basis of the percentage of clinical effectiveness and receiver operating characteristic curves.

METHODS: A total of 57 patients with metastatic prostate cancer aged 59-80 years (median 74 years) were entered in the study and were randomized to the treatment of estramustine phosphate (560 mg/day) plus LHRH agonist (estramustine group) or flutamide (375 mg/day) plus LHRH agonist (flutamide group) with stratification for the degree of performance status, histological differentiation and bone metastasis. RESULTS: Both of the treatment regimens were well tolerated with similar incidences of adverse drug reactions.

In this randomized study, we evaluated the anti-tumor effect and safety of PPV plus low-dose estramustine phosphate (EMP) as compared to standard-dose EMP for HLA-A2- or -A24-positive patients with castration resistant prostate cancer. Patients were randomized into groups receiving either PPV plus low-dose EMP (280 mg/day) or standard-dose EMP (560 mg/day). After disease progression, patients were switched to the opposite regime. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). We randomly assigned 28 patients to receive PPV plus low-dose EMP and 29 patients to receive standard-dose EMP. Nineteen events in the PPV group and 20 events in the EMP group occurred during the first treatment. Median PFS for the first treatment was 8.5 months in the PPV group and 2.8 months in the EMP group with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.28 (95% CI, 0.14-0.61; log-rank P = 0.0012), while there was no difference for median PFS for the second treatment. The HR for overall survival was 0.3 (95% CI, 0.1-0.91) in favor of the PPV plus low-dose EMP group (log-rank, P = 0.0328). The PPV plus low-dose EMP was well tolerated without major adverse effects and with increased levels of IgG and cytotoxic-T cell responses to the vaccinated peptides. PPV plus low-dose EMP was associated with an improvement in PSA-based PFS as compared to the standard-dose EMP alone. (c) 2010 Springer-Verlag","","","","","","","","","","","",""

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a cohort study of 23,087 incident patients with prostate cancer with a median 2.2-year followup identified through the Danish National Patient Registry from 1999 to 2007. We estimated the cumulative incidence of bone metastasis and skeletal related events, and described survival using the Kaplan-Meier method. Based on a Cox proportional hazard model we estimated mortality rate ratios and associated 95% CIs comparing mortality rates between patients by bone metastasis with and without skeletal related events, adjusting for age and comorbidity. RESULTS: Of the patients 569 (almost 3%) presented with bone metastasis at prostate cancer diagnosis, of whom 248 (43.6%) experienced a skeletal related event during followup. Of the 22,404 men (97% overall) without bone metastasis at diagnosis 2,578 (11.5%) were diagnosed with bone metastasis and 1,329 (5.9%) also experienced a skeletal related event during followup. One and 5-year survival was 87% and 56% in patients with prostate cancer without bone metastasis, 47% and 3% in those with bone metastasis, and 40% and less than 1% in those with bone metastasis and skeletal related events, respectively. Compared with men with prostate cancer without bone metastasis the adjusted 1-year mortality rate ratio was 4.7 (95% CI 4.3-5.2) in those with bone metastasis and no skeletal related events, and 6.6 (95% CI 5.9-7.5) in those with bone metastasis and a skeletal related event.

Our aim was to detect the proportion of bone and soft-tissue lesions that represent metabolically active tumor sites in patients with progressive metastatic prostate cancer. Methods: In a prospective study, we compared SUP 18F-FDG and L-methyl- SUP 11C-methionine ( SUP 11C-methionine) PET with conventional imaging modalities (CIM), which included the combination of SUP 99 mTc-methylene diphosphonate scintigraphy, CT, or MRI. Twelve patients with prostate cancer, increasing levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and at least 1 site (index lesion) with new or increasing disease on CIM were studied. The total numbers of soft-tissue and bone-tissue lesions, in a site-by-site comparison, were calculated for all imaging modalities. Results: The sensitivities of SUP 18F-FDG PET and SUP 11C-methionine PET were 48% (167/348 lesions) and 72.1% (251/348 lesions), respectively, with CIM being used as the 100% reference (348/348). SUP 11C-Methionine PET identified significantly more lesions than SUP 18F-FDG PET (P < 0.01). All 12 patients with progressive metastatic prostate cancer had at least 1 lesion site of active metabolism for SUP 18F-FDG or SUP 11C-methionine, which could be used as an index lesion to monitor the metabolic response to therapy. A significant proportion of lesions (26%) had no detectable metabolism of SUP 18F-FDG or SUP 11C-methionine. Although technical factors cannot be totally excluded, we believe that metabolically inactive sites may be necrotic or dormant. More than 95% (251/258) of metabolically active sites (72% of the total number of lesions detected by CIM) metabolize SUP 11C-methionine. SUP 18F-FDG uptake is more variable, with 65% of metabolically active sites (48% of the total number of lesions detected by CIM). Conclusion: These findings reflect the different biologic characteristics of the lesions in a heterogeneous tumor such as prostate cancer and suggest that a time-dependent metabolic cascade may occur in advanced prostate cancer, with initial uptake of SUP 11C-methionine in dormant sites followed by increased uptake of SUP 18F-FDG during progression of disease","","","","","","","","","","","",""

OBJECTIVES: To conduct a systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the efficacy of decision aids for people facing difficult treatment or screening decisions. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched MEDLINE (Ovid) (1966 to July 2006); Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library; 2006, Issue 2); CINAHL (Ovid) (1982 to July 2006); EMBASE (Ovid) (1980 to July 2006); and PsycINFO (Ovid) (1806 to July 2006). We contacted researchers active in the field up to December 2006. There were no language restrictions. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included published RCTs of interventions designed to aid patients' decision making by providing information about treatment or screening options and their associated outcomes, compared to no intervention, usual care, and alternate interventions. We excluded studies in which participants were not making an active treatment or screening decision, or if the study's intervention was not available to determine that it met the minimum criteria to qualify as a patient decision aid. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently screened abstracts for inclusion, and extracted data from included studies using standardized forms. The primary outcomes focused on the effectiveness criteria of the International Patient Decision Aid Standards (IPDAS) Collaboration: attributes of the decision and attributes of the decision process. We considered other behavioural, health, and health system effects as secondary outcomes. We pooled results of RCTs using mean differences (MD) and relative risks (RR) using a random effects model. MAIN RESULTS: This update added 25 new RCTs, bringing the total to 55. Thirty-eight (69%) used at least one measure that mapped onto an IPDAS effectiveness criterion: decision attributes: knowledge scores (27 trials); accurate risk perceptions (11 trials); and value congruence with chosen option (4 trials); and decision process attributes: feeling informed (15 trials) and feeling clear about values (13 trials).This review confirmed the following findings from the previous (2003) review. Decision aids performed better than usual care interventions in terms of: a) greater knowledge (MD 15.2 out of 100; 95% CI 11.7 to 18.7); b) lower decisional conflict related to feeling uninformed (MD -8.3 of 100; 95% CI -11.9 to -4.8); c) lower decisional conflict related to feeling unclear about personal values (MD -6.4; 95% CI -10.0 to -2.7); d) reduced the proportion of people who were passive in decision making (RR 0.6; 95% CI 0.5 to 0.8); and e) reduced proportion of people who remained undecided post-intervention (RR 0.5; 95% CI 0.3 to 0.8). When simpler decision aids were compared to more detailed decision aids, the relative improvement was significant in knowledge (MD 4.6 out of 100; 95% CI 3.0 to 6.2) and there was some evidence of greater agreement between values and choice.In this review, we were able to explore the use of probabilities in decision aids. Exposure to a decision aid with probabilities resulted in a higher proportion of people with accurate risk perceptions (RR 1.6; 95% CI 1.4 to 1.9). The effect was stronger when probabilities were measured quantitatively (RR 1.8; 95% CI 1.4 to 2.3) versus qualitatively (RR 1.3; 95% CI 1.1 to 1.5).As in the previous review, exposure to decision aids continued to demonstrate reduced rates of: elective invasive surgery in favour of conservative options, decision aid versus usual care (RR 0.8; 95% CI 0.6 to 0.9); and use of menopausal hormones, detailed versus simple aid (RR 0.7; 95% CI 0.6 to 1.0). There is now evidence that exposure to decision aids results in reduced PSA screening, decision aid versus usual care (RR 0.8; 95% CI 0.7 to 1.0) . For other decisions, the effect on decisions remains variable.As in the previous review, decision aids are no better than comparisons in affecting satisfaction with decision making, anxiety, and health outcomes. The effects of decision aids on other outcomes (patient-practitioner communication, consultation length, continuance, resource use) were inconclusive.There were no trials evaluating the IPDAS decision process criteria relating to helping patients to recognize a decision needs to be made, understand that values affect the decision, or discuss values with the practitioner. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Patient decision aids increase people's involvement and are more likely to lead to informed values-based decisions; however, the size of the effect varies across studies. Decision aids have a variable effect on decisions. They reduce the use of discretionary surgery without apparent adverse effects on health outcomes or satisfaction. The degree of detail patient decision aids require for positive effects on decision quality should be explored. The effects on continuance with chosen option, patient-practitioner communication, consultation length, and cost-effectiveness need further evaluation. DECISION AIDS TO HELP PEOPLE WHO ARE FACING HEALTH TREATMENT OR SCREENING DECISIONS: Making a decision about the best option to manage health can be difficult. Getting information on the options and the possible benefits and harms in the form of decision aids may help. Decision aids, such as pamphlets and videos that describe options, are designed to help people understand the options, consider the personal importance of possible benefits and harms, and participate in decision making. They are used when there is more than one medically reasonable option - no option has a clear advantage in terms of health outcomes, each has benefits and harms that people value differently. The updated review of trials found that decision aids improve people's knowledge of the options, create accurate risk perceptions of their benefits and harms, reduce difficulty with decision making, and increase participation in the process. They may have a role in preventing use of options that informed patients don't value without adversely affecting health outcomes. They did not seem to have an effect on satisfaction with decision making or anxiety","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There have been many developments in imaging techniques and radiopharmaceuticals over the years allowing more reliable detection of metastatic spread to bone. Other imaging modalities are also evolving roles in the detection of metastatic spread including computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography (PET). Despite this, isotope bone scans continue to have a central role in detection and surveillance of bone metastases in breast and prostate cancer. Paralleling developments in imaging there have been enormous changes in the treatment options available for cancers of the breast and prostate that have metastasised to bone. Bone specific treatments including radionuclides and bisphosphonates as well as high dose chemotherapy provide potential improvement in disease control. There is also evidence that earlier treatment of bone metastases may prolong survival. This increases the need for efficient methods of detection and monitoring of disease. In this article we discuss the efficacy of bone sc intigraphy in breast and prostate cancer from the point of view of staging, systematic follow-up of asymptomatic patients, evaluation of symptomatic patients and the assessment of response to therapy","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: Eligible patients had progressive HRPC metastatic to bone, good performance status and minimal soft tissue disease. Patients received 5,000 MBq of (186)Re-HEDP i.v., followed 14 days later by PBSCT. Response was assessed using PSA, survival, pain scores and quality of life. RESULTS: Thirty-eight patients with a median age of 67 years (range 50-77) and a median PSA of 57 ng/ml (range 4-3,628) received a median activity of 4,978 MBq (186)Re-HEDP (range 4,770-5,100 MBq). The most serious toxicity was short-lived grade 3 thrombocytopenia in 8 (21%) patients.

Thirty-one patients (81%, 95% CI 66-90%) had stable or reduced PSA levels 3 months post therapy while 11 (29%, 95% CI 15-49%) had PSA reductions of >50% lasting >4 weeks. Quality of life measures were stable or improved in 27 (66%) at 3 months. CONCLUSION: We have shown that it is feasible and safe to deliver high-activity radioisotope therapy with PBSCT to men with metastatic HRPC.

Oral estrogens prevented many of these problems but were abandoned due to cardiovascular toxicity attributed to hepatic effect. In contrast, parenteral estrogens prevent first pass hepatic metabolism and substantially reduce cardiovascular risk, and long-term transdermal estradiol therapy is believed to be cardioprotective. We report preliminary results of a pilot study using transdermal estradiol therapy to treat men with advanced prostate cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 20 patients with advanced prostate cancer were enrolled in a before and after study that examined the impact of estradiol patches on hormones, disease, thrombophilia, vascular flow, osteoporosis and quality of life. RESULTS: Median followup is 15 months. Estradiol levels greater than 1,000 pmol./l. were achieved using 2 patches and higher levels were obtained by increasing the number of patches. All patients achieved castrate levels of testosterone within 3 weeks and had biochemical evidence of disease regression. One patient died of disease at 14 months and 1 cardiovascular complication occurred. Thrombophilic activation was avoided and vascular flow improved. Bone mineral density was significantly increased. Mild or moderate gynecomastia occurred in 80% of patients but no patient had hot flushes. All other functional and symptomatic quality of life domains improved. CONCLUSIONS: Transdermal estradiol therapy produced an effective tumor response. Cardiovascular toxicity was substantially reduced compared with that expected of oral estrogen, and other morbidity (gynecomastia) was negligible.

We have recently shown that transdermal estradiol is an effective alternative for such patients. Here we report the impact of transdermal estradiol therapy on the bone mineral density of men with prostate cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 20 patients with newly diagnosed locally advanced or metastatic prostate cancer were treated with transdermal estradiol patches. Bone mineral density of the lumbar spine and the proximal femur was measured with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, and correlated with computerized tomography and isotope bone scan findings at 6-month intervals. RESULTS: In all measured regions bone mineral density increased with time. By 1 year mean bone mineral density +/- SEM had increased by 3.60% +/- 1.6% in the lumbar spine (p = 0.055), 2.19% +/- 1.03% in the femoral neck (p = 0.055), 3.76% +/- 1.35% in the Ward's region (p = 0.008) and 1.90% +/- 0.85% in the total hip (p = 0.031), respectively. Of 12 osteoporotic sites 4 had improvement based on World Health Organization grading. All other sites improved toward a better classification. CONCLUSIONS: Transdermal estradiol protects against bone loss in men with prostate cancer and may improve bone density in those at risk for osteoporotic fracture","","","","","","00005392-200412010-00021 [pii]","Department of Surgical Oncology and Technology, Imperial College and Hammersmith Hospitals NHS Trust, London, United Kingdom","PM:15538232","","","",""

The aim of our study was to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of a bi-weekly chemohormonal regimen consisting of epirubicin, etoposide, and low-dose dexamethasone (EED) in patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC). METHODS: We treated a total of 32 patients who had failed hormonal therapy and antiandrogen withdrawal. Chemotherapy was given every 2 weeks and consisted of epirubicin (30 mg/m2 intravenously, day 1) and etoposide (50 mg/m2 orally, days 1-7). Dexamethasone (1.5 mg orally, every other day) was given continuously until disease progression. Twenty patients (63%) had received prior treatment with estramustine phosphate. Each patient's pain response was evaluated according to analgesic use. Toxicity was graded using the Common Toxicity Criteria (version 2.0). RESULTS: Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels showed a decline of 50% or greater in 16 of 32 patients (50%, 95% confidence interval [CI], 32-68%) with a median time to biochemical progression of 5 months (range, 4-9 months). The median survival for all patients was 10.5 months (range, 3-35 months). Four of 10 patients (40%) with measurable soft tissue lesions achieved partial response according to standard criteria. Eleven of 23 symptomatic patients (48%, 95% CI, 27-69%) experienced an improvement in pain with a median duration of 6 months. The regimen was tolerated well by the patients, with only four patients (12%) having grade 3 leukopenia.

The total cost included activity costs, materials costs, and facility costs. Median overall administration time was 99.8 minutes (breast cancer, 101.3 minutes; prostate cancer, 98.4 minutes), including 60.0 minutes among patients with no chemotherapy (n = 39) and 139.9 minutes among chemotherapy recipients (n = 29), largely due to 67.9 minutes for chemotherapy in fusion. The overall median cost was $1,880 (no chemotherapy, $1,184; chemotherapy, $3,784).

Standard androgen deprivation strategies for prostate cancer typically lead to castrate levels of testosterone. One alternative is the use of finasteride and flutamide. METHODS: A Phase II trial evaluated the combination of finasteride (5 mg/day) and flutamide (250 mg three times daily) in patients with rising prostate-specific antigen levels after local treatment for prostate cancer or with newly discovered metastatic disease. Patients were followed up for subsequent events, including castration-free, androgen-independent prostate cancer (AIPC)-free, and overall survival. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 88 months, 5 patients (25%) continued on finasteride and flutamide, and 12 had stopped this combination and subsequently underwent medical or surgical castration. No patients experienced a flutamide withdrawal effect. All patients experienced more than a 50% decline in prostate-specific antigen after castration (mean 89%). The median protocol treatment failure-free survival was 29.9 months, the median castration-free survival was 37 months, and the median AIPC-free survival was 48.6 months. At 5 years, the overall survival rate was 65% (95% confidence interval 47% to 90%); 29% were alive and have not required castration, and 35% were alive and free of AIPC. CONCLUSIONS: Finasteride and flutamide have a durable effect in suppressing prostate-specific antigen progression in some men with advanced prostate cancer. Furthermore, castration induces secondary responses that may be of shorter duration than if started initially, although the overall period of hormonally responsive prostate cancer is more than 4 years","","","","","","S0090429503001456 [pii]","Lank Center for Genitourinary Oncology, Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA","PM:12837431","","","",""

The aim of this study was to evaluate whether pretreatment serum HER2 levels can be used to predict biochemical recurrence-free survival in prostate cancer patients about to undergo endocrine therapy. METHODS: The study population consisted of 379 untreated patients with histologically diagnosed prostate cancer: 197 with T2N0M0, 93 with T3N0M0, 19 with TxN1Mx, and 70 with TxNxM1. Serum HER2 levels were assessed in the prostate cancer patients prior to treatment as well as in a control group of 100 patients with histologically confirmed non-cancer. Biochemical recurrence-free curves for the patients were investigated separately using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: The mean level of HER2 in serum was significantly higher in prostate cancer patients than non-prostate cancer patients (P = 0.006). Also, the serum HER2 level was significantly higher in bone metastatic cancer patients (14.3 +/- 6.3 ng/mL) than in non-metastatic patients (T2: 11.9 +/- 2.3 ng/mL, P = 0.003; T3: 12.2 +/- 2.8 ng/mL, P = 0.011). The metastatic patients were divided into those with low and high HER2 levels using a cutoff value of 12.6 ng/mL based on receiver-operating characteristic curves. The biochemical recurrence-free rate was significantly poorer in patients with a high HER2 level (P = 0.0078, log-rank test). Multivariate Cox logistic regression analysis demonstrated that the pretreatment serum HER2 value (P = 0.022), serum prostate-specific antigen value (P = 0.018), and extent of disease score (P = 0.027) were independent predictors of recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: The pretreatment serum HER2 level may be a useful independent prognostic factor that is associated with a high risk of biochemical recurrence in metastatic prostate cancer patients about to undergo endocrine therapy","","","","","","IJU1533 [pii];10.1111/j.1442-2042.2006.01533.x [doi]","Department of Urology, Kyorin University School of Medicine, Mitaka, Tokyo, Japan. toke@kyorin-u.ac.jp","PM:16984552","","","",""

In the absence of other effective and approved drugs we evaluated the toxicity and efficacy of intermittent-docetaxel-chemotherapy in patients whose cancers progressed after successful first-line docetaxel therapy. METHODS: 46, 18, and 5 patients with HRPC received 1, 2, or 3 cycles of docetaxel based chemotherapy. Toxicity, PSA response and general condition were evaluated systematically. SPSS 15.0 was applied for statistic analysis. RESULTS: 26 (56 %) patients achieved a PSA response of > 50 %, another 10 (22 %) patients of up to 50 %; 10 (22 %) patients were progressive under docetaxel. The median overall survival of the whole cohort calculated from the first docetaxel application was 16 (3-60 +) months. Tolerance, toxicity and general condition were crucial for the administration of a second cycle (n = 18); in contrast, age or the degree of the PSA decline in cycle 1 did not seem to be of importance. The -median overall survival of all patients who -received at least two blocks was 35 months; more-over, 13 / 18 patients achieved a biochemical response in cycle 2. Toxicity did not rise significantly. Five patients were given a third docetaxel cycle, three of whom responded. Higher frequencies of -grade 3 / 4 stomatitis, skin toxicity and leukocytopaenia were observed. CONCLUSION: Intermittent docetaxel therapy is well tolerated and shows high response rates in the sec-ond and third sequences of treatment in select-ed HRPC patients who presented with low docetaxel toxicity, good clinical condition and responded to prior docetaxel-based treatment","","","","","","10.1055/s-0028-1098888 [doi]","Klinik fur Urologie und Kinderurologie, Philipps-Universitat Marburg, Baldingerstrasse, Marburg","PM:19370533","","","",""

The costs of both treatments were also assessed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 101 patients were randomized to S and 102 to R. Time to event endpoints were compared with the Logrank test and Kaplan-Meier curves, in the intent-to-treat population (2-sided alpha=0.05). RESULTS: Baseline characteristics of both groups were comparable. There was a borderline statistically significant difference in overall survival in favour of the local field radiotherapy (R: 11 months; S: 7.2 months; p=0.0457). There was no difference in progression-free survival or time to progression. Subjective response was seen in 34.7% in the S-arm and in 33.3% in the R-arm. A biochemical response was observed in 10% and 13% of the R- and S-groups, respectively. There was no difference in treatment toxicity between the two groups. CONCLUSION: In symptomatic HRPC, pain treatment with local field radiotherapy is associated with a better overall survival compared to Strontium(89). The lower costs of local field radiotherapy also favour the use of this treatment in patients with HRPC. The reason for the apparent survival benefit of localised radiation treatment is not clear","","","","","","S0302283803003646 [pii]","Department of Urology, Academic Hospital, Nijmegen, The Netherlands. g.oosterhof@urology.azm.nl","PM:14572748","","","",""

Skeletal metastases often occur in patients with malignancies. Recent developments suggest that bone markers could be valuable clinical tools for the management of patients with metastatic bone disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Serum levels of BAP, along with serum levels of beta-CrossLap, were measured in a large group (n = 200) of patients with newly-diagnosed or progressive cancer of the prostate, breast, colon, liver and pancreas. Tumour markers such as PSA, CEA, CA 19-9, AFP, CA 15-3 and bone marker levels were correlated with the presence or absence of bone scan-documented metastases. RESULTS: Both of the bone markers examined were elevated in a high proportion of patients with confirmed metastases to bone. All patients with prostate, breast and colon carcinoma showed elevated beta-CrossLap values. The determined values of beta-CrossLap and BAP were significantly correlated with the number of skeletal metastases. CONCLUSION: Markers of biochemical bone remodeling can be used in assessing and managing patients with malignancies that metastasize to bone. These markers are abnormally raised in the blood of patients with metastatic bone disease","","","","","","","University Hospital Frankfurt/Main, Central Laboratory, Theodor-Stem-Kai 7, D-60590 Frankfurt/Main, Germany","PM:12820336","","","",""

We studied its frequency in prostate cancer patients receiving intravenous zoledronate. The medical and dental records of 52 consecutive patients with prostate cancer and bone metastases treated at our institute between January 2002 and October 2005 were reviewed. All patients received intravenous zoledronate 4 mg every 3 or 4 weeks and concomitant conventional prostate cancer treatments. We analysed the association of ONJ with the number of administrations of zoledronate and exposure to chemotherapy. At a median follow-up of 7 months (range 1-41) after the initiation of zoledronate, ONJ occurred in six patients (12%, 95% C.I. 5.4-23.0%). All six ONJ cases occurred after the 9th administration of zoledronate. The median number of zoledronate administrations was 17 (range 9-24) and 8 (range 1-32) for patient dev eloping and not developing ONJ, respectively (p =0.02). Chemotherapy with docetaxel was also associated with a strong, but not statistically significant, trend towards increased risk of ONJ (OR 3.8, 95% C.I. 0.4-35.6, p =0.24). The length of exposure to zoledronate was associated with an increased frequency of ONJ in prostate cancer patients. A possible role of chemotherapy with docetaxel as a cofactor for ONJ merits further evaluation. (c) 2007 Taylor & Francis","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For tumors T1-3 N0M0 at the high risk of local relapse after prostatectomy, an immediate radiotherapy compared with a differed radiotherapy (at the time of PSA relapse), showed a significant reduction in the rate of local relapse and an ameliorated progression free survival. The effectiveness of the docetaxel was confirmed in two phase III randomized clinical trials: TAX-327 with 3 arms compared docetaxel every 21 days, docetaxel every 7 days and mitoxantrone. All arms were prednisone-based. An increase in overall survival, PSA progression free survival, PSA response rate and a pain reduction were highlighted in the docetaxel arm every 21 days. Docetaxel obtained at the end of this study the marketing authorization in this indication and became the treatment of reference. The SWOG 99-16 study compared the docetaxel estramustine association with the same arm of reference, mitoxantrone and prednisone, with similar results. The addition of estramustine to the docetaxel seems to improve the PSA response rate and progression free survival, but with a greater embolic toxicity. The addition of an antiangiogenic agent, the thalidomide, to docetaxel, improves progression free survival and overall survival. PSA responses were observed with an inhibitor of the proteasome, the bortezomib, in monotherapy, contrary to the imatinib which in monotherapy didn't have any effectiveness. Studies in association with docetaxel are ongoing. Some biological responses were observed with a vaccine anti MUC-1 and must be confirmed on a greater series of patients. The docetaxel impact on localized disease is actually evaluated. (c) John Libbey Eurotext","","","","","","","","","","","",""

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-seven men with progressive metastatic prostate cancer refractory to first-line or second-line hormonal therapy were treated with vinorelbine, a semisynthetic vinca-alkaloid. Vinorelbine was given, on an outpatient schedule, at 25 mg/m2 weekly for at least eight weeks or until progression or excessive toxicity. RESULTS: Forty-seven patients were included in the study, 33 being evaluable for tumour response, 36 for response to PSA, 21 for clinical benefit and 45 for toxicity. Median actual weekly dose was 19 mg/m2 (range 12.0-26.2 mg/m2). Six of thirty-six patients (17%) demonstrated a biologic response with a 50% or more decline in serum PSA on two consecutive measurements taken at least two weeks apart. The median duration of biologic response was 2.7 months. Two of three patients with measurable disease obtained an objective response but remained unconfirmed. No change disease was reported in 23 patients (49%). On entry into the study, 30 patients had symptomatic bone pain and required narcotic or non-narcotic analgesics. Clinical benefit from vinorelbine was achieved in 15 patients out of 21 (32% of the intent to treat analysis population and 71% of the assessable patients). Due to the low number of questionnaires (QLQ-C30) filled in, it was insufficient to allow any statistical analysis. The median survival was 10.2 months. Toxicity was mainly haematologic with 51% of patients experiencing grade 3 or 4 granulocytopenia. Three patients developed deep vein thrombosis. Non-haematologic toxicity, mainly nausea and neurotoxicity, was mild. CONCLUSION: The administration of weekly vinorelbine appears to be a safe treatment for those patients with androgen-independent prostate cancer and poor prognosis features who require chemotherapy. These results provide data for future investigation of vinorelbine in combination regimens","","","","","","","Department of Oncology, Hjpital Europeen Georges Pompidou, Paris, France. stephane.oudard@hop.egp.ap-hop-paris.fr","PM:11484963","","","",""

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data were analysed from 145 patients with HRPC treated with chemotherapy between February 2000 and June 2002 in one French centre. Eligible patients were categorized into three groups according to the bone pain at baseline, i.e. minimal/no pain, mild, and moderate/severe pain. The primary endpoint was the effect of bone pain on overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Docetaxel was administered to 67% of patients. The risk of death was 1.56 and 2.11 times higher for patients with mild or moderate/severe pain than for those with minimal/no pain (P = 0.027). The median (95% confidence interval (CI)) OS was 23.1 (18.5-27.6) and 14.1 (8.9-19.2) months (P = 0.001, log-rank-test) for patients with minimal pain or no pain treated with docetaxel-based chemotherapy compared with mitoxantrone, respectively. The prostate-specific antigen doubling time (PSA-DT) had a significant effect on OS in patients with minimal/no pain, with a median of 32.4 and 16.5 months for a PSA-DT of >or=45 and <45 days, respectively (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that patients with HRPC and minimal or no bone pain could have better survival than those with mild pain or moderate to severe pain, independent of the treatment administered. In addition, patients with HRPC and minimal or no bone pain treated with docetaxel-based chemotherapy have a significantly better OS than those treated with mitoxantrone. The PSA-DT can be useful to identify asymptomatic patients who are candidates for early treatment","","","","","","BJU8283 [pii];10.1111/j.1464-410X.2008.08283.x [doi]","Medical Oncology Department, Georges Pompidou European Hospital, Paris Rene Descartes University, Paris, France. stephane.oudard@egp.aphp.fr","PM:19210673","","","",""

The uptake of (11)C-acetate in prostate cancer was investigated to determine whether this tracer has potential in tumor identification. METHODS: Twenty-two patients with prostate cancer underwent PET after intravenous administration of 740 MBq (11)C-acetate. Eighteen of the 22 patients were also investigated with (18)F-FDG PET. Standardized uptake values (SUVs) for each tumor were investigated for tracer activity at 10-20 min after (11)C-acetate and 40-60 min after (18)F-FDG administration. RESULTS: Adenocarcinoma of the prostate showed variable uptake of (11)C-acetate, with SUVs ranging from 3.27 to 9.87. In contrast, SUVs for (18)F-FDG ranged from 1.97 to 6.34. By visual inspection, (11)C-acetate accumulation in primary prostate tumors was positive in all patients, whereas (18)F-FDG accumulation was positive in only 15 of 18 patients. (11)C-Acetate PET in a patient with lymph node metastasis showed high intrapelvic accumulation corresponding to metastatic sites. Similarly, 2 patients with bone metastases were (11)C-acetate avid. CONCLUSION: (11)C-Acetate shows marked uptake in prostate cancer and is more sensitive in detection of prostate cancer than is (18)F-FDG PET. (11)C-Acetate represents a new tracer for detection of prostate cancer with PET, measuring radiopharmaceutical uptake pathways that are different from those measured by (18)F-FDG","","","","","","","Department of Urology, Fukui Medical University, Fukui, Japan.

A local recurrence would be amenable to additional local therapy with curative intent, whereas metastatic disease would require palliative androgen ablation therapy. In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of PET with (11)C-acetate (AC PET) for evaluation of patients with rising PSA after radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy. We also compared the reliability of AC PET in detecting recurrent prostate cancer with that of PET with (18)F-FDG. METHODS: Two groups of patients with PSA recurrence were enrolled in this study: group A, 30 patients after prostatectomy, and group B, 16 patients after radiation therapy. After administration of 1,110 MBq (30 mCi) of (11)C-acetate, whole-body PET images were obtained. After allowing for (11)C decay, 555 MBq (15 mCi) of (18)F-FDG were administered and repeated whole-body imaging was performed. The PET findings were scored as positive or negative in each of the following regions: prostatic bed, pelvic nodes, paraaortic nodes, and other sites (bone or soft tissue). PET findings were correlated with those of CT, bone scintigraphy, and biopsy. RESULTS: Twenty-seven of 46 AC PET studies (59%) had positive findings, whereas only 8 (18)F-FDG PET studies had positive findings (17%). Limiting the analysis to patients with findings confirmed by CT, bone scintigraphy, or biopsy or considered highly likely to represent tumor, 14 (30%) had disease identified by AC PET, whereas only 4 (9%) had disease identified by (18)F-FDG PET. CT was performed on 22 patients and had positive findings in 3 (14%). Thirteen of 22 patients (59%) with serum PSA > 3 ng/mL had positive AC PET findings, whereas only 1 of 24 patients (4%) with serum PSA levels < or = 3 ng/mL had positive findings. CONCLUSION: AC PET demonstrates marked uptake in prostate cancer and has higher sensitivity than (18)F-FDG PET.

Materials and methods: The study group consisted of 17 stage T4 prostate cancer patients treated with CAB and had no evidence of bone metastasis on bone scintigraphy. The mean duration of CAB and final total prostate specific antigen (PSA) level at the time of study were found at 28.5 +/- 15.9 (6-58) months and 0.39 +/- 0.5 (0.1-2) ngml, respectively. Twenty age and socioeconomically matched benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) patients were taken as the control group. Both groups were c ompared with regard to lumbar bone mineral density (LBD), femur bone mineral density (FBD) and serum parameters of bone metabolism namely calcium (Ca), phosphate (P), magnesium (Mg) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP). Bone mineral density was measured with dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. Results: The mean FBD, LBD and serum Ca, P, Mg and ALP measurement of the patients treated with CAB were 0.85 +/- 0.1 g/cm SUP 2, 1.16 +/- 0.2 g/cm SUP 2, 9.1 +/- 0.3 mg/dl, 3.6 +/- 0.6 mg/dl, 1.95 +/- 0.14 mg/dl, 187.5 +/- 61 mg/dl, respectively. No significant difference was found between patients subjected to CAB and the age matched controls in any of the studied parameters namely age, FBD, LBD, Ca, Mg and ALP except serum phosphate. Serum phosphate levels were significantly (p = 0.001) higher in patients treated with CAB suggesting a minor effect of CAB on bone metabolism. Conclusion: No convincing evidence was found about the detrimental effect of CAB on bone mineral density and metabolism in a highly selected group of patients with advanced prostate cancer without bone metastases","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Patients and methods: The medical records of all patients who underwent salvage postoperative EBRT for either biochemical or clinical local recurrence were reviewed. Primary endpoints were the incidence of clinical and biochemical recurrences, metastases and death. Results: A total of 11 patients with biochemical recurrence were included. Four of them had clinical local recurrence as well. Postoperatively, all patients had pT1-T2N0M0 stage and therefore had low risk for recurrence. However, they were admitted for EBRT with recurrent disease with a mean pre-RT prostatic specific antigen (PSA) of 10 ng/ml. The daily dose of radiotherapy (RT) was 1.8 to 2.0 Gy and the median total dose was 64.8 Gy. All of the patients but one achieved PSA nadir value (<0.5 ng/ml) after RT. With a median follow up of 21 months (range 9-42 months), 5 (45.5%) patients had b iochemical failure, 2 (18.18%) developed clinical local recurrence, one (9.1%) developed bone metastases and 2 (18.18%) died. No serious long-term toxicity was observed. Conclusion: Despite the small sample size of our study that precluded any further analyses on prognostic factors affecting outcomes after salvage EBRT, we achieved satisfactory results regarding local control of disease, metastases and survival.

It has been claimed that acupuncture has a role in management of cancer pain and guidelines exist for treatment of cancer pain with acupuncture. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate efficacy of acupuncture for relief of cancer-related pain in adults. SEARCH STRATEGY: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, AMED, and SPORTDiscus were searched up to November 2010 including non-English language papers. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating any type of invasive acupuncture for pain directly related to cancer in adults of 18 years or over. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: It was planned to pool data to provide an overall measure of effect and to calculate the number needed to treat to benefit, but this was not possible due to heterogeneity. Two review authors (CP, OT) independently extracted data adding it to data extraction sheets. Quality scores were given to studies. Data sheets were compared and discussed with a third review author (MJ) who acted as arbiter. Data analysis was conducted by CP, OT and MJ. MAIN RESULTS: Three RCTs (204 participants) were included. One high quality study investigated the effect of auricular acupuncture compared with auricular acupuncture at 'placebo' points and with non-invasive vaccaria ear seeds attached at 'placebo' points. Participants in two acupuncture groups were blinded but blinding wasn't possible in the ear seeds group because seeds were attached using tape. This may have biased results in favour of acupuncture groups. Participants in the real acupuncture group had lower pain scores at two month follow-up than either the placebo or ear seeds group.There was high risk of bias in two studies because of low methodological quality. One study comparing acupuncture with medication concluded that both methods were effective in controlling pain, although acupuncture was the most effective. The second study compared acupuncture, point-injection and medication in participants with stomach cancer. Long-term pain relief was reported for both acupuncture and point-injection compared with medication during the last 10 days of treatment. Although both studies have positive results in favour of acupuncture they should be viewed with caution due to methodological limitations, small sample sizes, poor reporting and inadequate analysis. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is insufficient evidence to judge whether acupuncture is effective in treating cancer pain in adults. ACUPUNCTURE FOR CANCER-RELATED PAIN IN ADULTS: Up to 70% of patients with cancer-related pain do not receive adequate pain relief and this reduces their quality of life. Acupuncture may have a role to play in relieving cancer-related pain. This review evaluated evidence for the effectiveness of acupuncture in reducing pain associated with cancer or its treatment, or both. We found three studies (looking at a total of 204 participants) which met our inclusion criteria, but all had small sample sizes, leaving them prone to bias, and only one study was judged to be of high methodological quality. The high quality study found that auricular (ear) acupuncture reduced cancer-related pain when compared with auricular acupuncture at non acupuncture points, but the control group was not adequately blinded and this was likely to affect the outcomes. Of the low quality studies, one found that acupuncture was as effective as medication, and one study found that acupuncture was more effective than medication, but both studies were poorly designed and the study reports lacked detail. We concluded that there was insufficient evidence to judge whether acupuncture is effective in relieving cancer-related pain in adults","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Twenty-two patients received a single injection of escalating doses of carrier-added 188Re-HEDP [1.3 GBq (35 mCi), 2.6 GBq (70 mCi), 3.3 GBq (90 mCi) and 4.4 GBq (120 mCi)]. Blood counts and biochemical parameters were measured weekly over a period of 8 weeks. Haematological toxicity (WHO grading) of grade 3 or 4 was considered unacceptable. Clinical follow-up studies including methods of pain documentation (medication, pain diary) were performed for 6 months after treatment. In the 1.3-GBq group, no haematological toxicity was observed. First haematotoxic results were noted in those patients with a dose of 2.6 GBq 188Re-HEDP. In the 3.3-GBq group, one patient showed a reversible thrombopenia of grade 1, one a reversible thrombopenia of grade 2 and three a reversible leukopenia of grade 1. In the 4.4-GBq group, thrombopenia of grades 3 and 4 was observed in one and two patients (baseline thrombocyte count <200x10(9)/l), respectively, and leukopenia of grade 3 was documented in one patient. The overall nadir of thrombopenia was at week 4. The individual, maximum percentage decrease in thrombocytes in the 1.3-, 2.6-, 3.3- and 4.4-GBq groups was 17%, 40%, 60% and 86%, respectively. In two patients, a transient increase in serum creatinine was observed (max. 1.6 mg/dl). Pain palliation was reported by 64% of patients, with a mean duration of 7.5 weeks. The response rate seemed to increase with higher doses, reaching 75% in the 4.4-GBq group. It is concluded that in prostate cancer patients, the maximum tolerated dose of 188Re-HEDP is 3.3 GBq if the baseline thrombocyte count is below 200x10(9)/l. In patients with thrombocyte counts significantly above 200x10(9)/l, a dose of 4.4 GBq might be tolerable. Thrombo- and leukopenia are the most important side-effects. Pain palliation can be achieved in 60%-75% of patients receiving a dose of 2.6 GBq or more of 188Re-HEDP. Studies in a larger patient population are warranted to evaluate further the palliative effect of 188Re-HEDP","","","","","","","Department of Nuclear Medicine, University of Bonn, Germany","PM:10755716","","","",""

The aim of this study was to determine the pain palliation and the antitumor effect of rhenium-188 HEDP treatments. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-four patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups for radionuclide therapy with rhenium-188 HEDP; patients of group A received a single injection, patients of group B received two injections (interval, 8 weeks). After therapy, patients were followed-up by assessment of pain palliation and clinical outcome until death. RESULTS: In both groups, toxicity was low, with moderate thrombopenia and leukopenia (maximum common toxicity criteria grade of 2). The effectiveness of rhenium-188 HEDP for pain palliation was better in the repeated treatment group (group B), with a response rate and time of response of 92% and 5.66 months, respectively (P =.006 and P =.001). In group B, 11 (39%) of 28 patients had a prostate-specific antigen decrease of more than 50% for at least 8 weeks, compared with two (7%) of 30 patients in the single-injection group (group A). The median times to progression of group A and group B were 2.3 months (range, 0 to 12.2 months) and 7.0 months (range, 0 to 24.1 months), respectively (P =.0013), and the median overall survival times were 7.0 months (range, 1.3 to 36.7 months) and 12.7 months (range, 4.1 to 32.2 months), respectively (P =.043). CONCLUSION: Compared with single-injection therapy, repeated bone-targeted therapy with rhenium-188 HEDP administered to patients with advanced progressive hormone-refractory prostate carcinoma enhanced pain palliation and improved progression-free and overall survival.

A pilot trial was performed in patients with prostate cancer using repetitive administrations of escalating masses of J591. An analysis was performed to assess lesion detectability by (111)In-J591 gamma-camera imaging compared with standard imaging methods and the effect of increasing antibody mass on lesion detectability, biodistribution, and dosimetry. METHODS: Fourteen patients with metastatic prostate cancer received escalating amounts (10, 25, 50, and 100 mg) of J591 in a series of administrations each separated by 3 wk. All antibody administrations included a fixed amount of the radiolabeled antibody (111)In-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-N,N',N'',N'''-tetraacetic acid-J591 ((111)In-DOTA-J591) (2 mg of J591 labeled with 185 MBq [5 mCi] of (111)In via the chelating agent DOTA). Three whole-body gamma-camera scans with at least 1 SPECT scan together with multiple whole-body counting-rate measurements and serum activity-concentration measurements were obtained in all patients. Images were analyzed for distribution and lesion targeting. Estimates of clearance rates and liver and lesion uptake were made for each treatment cycle. These estimates were used to generate dosimetric projections for radioimmunotherapy with (90)Y-labeled J591. RESULTS: A total of 80 lesions in 14 patients were detected. Both skeletal and soft-tissue diseases were targeted by the antibody as seen on (111)In-J591 scans. The antibody localized to 93.7% of skeletal lesions detected by conventional imaging. Clearance of radioactivity from the whole body, serum, and liver was dependent on antibody mass. Normalized average values of the ratio of residence times between lesion and liver for 10, 25, 50, and 100 mg of antibody were 1.0, 1.9, 3.2, and 4.0. Dosimetric projections for radioimmunotherapy with (90)Y-labeled J591 suggested similar absorbed doses to lesions for treatment at the maximally tolerated activity (MTA), irrespective of antibody mass. However, absorbed doses to liver at the MTA would be antibody mass-dependent with estimates of 20, 10, 7, and 5 Gy for 10, 25, 50, and 100 mg of J591. CONCLUSION: The proportion of the amount of antibody increased in lesions and decreased in the liver with increasing mass of administered antibody up to a dose of 50 mg. Proportional hepatic uptake continued to decrease with increasing antibody mass up to 100 mg. The optimal antibody mass for radioimmunotherapy would therefore appear to be greater than or equal to 50 mg","","","","","","jnumed.107.049502 [pii];10.2967/jnumed.107.049502 [doi]","Nuclear Medicine Service, Department of Radiology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10021, USA. pandit-n@mskcc.org","PM:18552139","","","",""

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with SCPCa (pure or mixed), measurable disease, good organ function, and no prior treatment with doxorubicin, etoposide, or cisplatin were treated every 4 weeks with doxorubicin 50 mg/m(2) as a 24-hour intravenous (IV) infusion followed by etoposide 120 mg/m(2)/d and cisplatin 25 mg/m(2)/d IV on days 2 to 4. RESULTS: Thirty-eight patients (36 assessable for response) were treated for a median of four cycles. Twenty-nine (81%) of 36 patients had prior hormonal therapy. Study patients had visceral metastases, lytic bone disease, and relatively low serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA). We observed 22 partial responses (response rate, 61% in an intent-to-treat analysis); toxicity was severe (grade 3 or 4 neutropenia 100%, thrombocytopenia 66%, mucositis 21%, and infection 68%). Three patients died of toxicity. Median time to progression and overall survival time were 5.8 months and 10.5 months, respectively. Performance status, serum albumin, and number of organs involved (but not PSA, carcinoembryonic antigen, or neuroendocrine markers) were predictors of survival. CONCLUSION: SCPCa presents unique clinicopathologic features. Addition of doxorubicin to the etoposide/cisplatin regimen caused higher toxicity in this patient population and failed to improve outcome. Given these results, we do not recommend further development of this regimen for patients with SCPCa. Improvement in therapy will come from understanding the biology of SCPCa progression and integrating new targeted therapies into the treatment of SCPCa","","","","","","","Department of Genitourinary Medical Oncology, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA. cpapandr@notes.mdacc.tmc.edu","PM:12118020","","","",""

Prostate carcinoma metastasizes frequently to the skeleton, causing significant morbidity, particularly severe bone pain. Metastatic lesions typically are osteosclerotic, hut there is experimental, histologic, and biochemical evidence of increased bone resorption. Furthermore, bone resorption rates appear to correlate with bone pain. These observations provide the rationale for the use of bisphosphonates in the management of patients with prostate carcinoma and skeletal metastases. METHODS. The authors reviewed the literature and current findings on the use of biphosphonates in the management of patients with prostate carcinoma metastatic to the skeleton. RESULTS. Compared with the large number of studies with bisphosphonates in predominantly osteolytic bone disease, there have been relatively few (mostly uncontrolled) studies in patients with prostate carcinoma. Apart from the lack of appropriate experimental models, the osteoblastic nature of the metastases and the low incidence of objectively assessed endpoints of treatment (e.g., hypercalcemia, pathologic fractures) have delayed developments. Available data, however, strongly suggest that potent bisphosphonates are efficacious in reducing skeletal morbidity in patients with prostate carcinoma. CONCLUSIONS. For the optimal management of patients with skeletal metastases from prostate carcinoma with bisphosphonates their mode of administration, the dose and duration of treatment need to be evaluated. Better understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying bone metastases can lead to the design of improved treatment protocols with potent bisphosphonates.

OBJECTIVE: To examine biochemical, local and metastatic patterns of recurrence in patients undergoing SP for radiation-recurrent prostate cancer. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: 146 patients with biopsy-proven local recurrence of prostate cancer after radiation therapy treated with SP were evaluated in a retrospective study at a single institution. INTERVENTION: All patients underwent SP by mainly two surgeons. MEASUREMENTS: Biochemical recurrence (BCR) after SP was defined as a serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level of >or=0.2 ng/ml or was defined by the initiation of androgen deprivation therapy. All predictors analyzed were determined after radiotherapy, before SP, and included PSA level, clinical stage, biopsy Gleason score, age at SP, and time interval from radiotherapy to SP. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Of the 146 patients treated with SP, 65 developed BCR. The median follow-up period for recurrence-free patients was 3.8 yr; 43 patients (29%) were followed for >5 yr. Overall, the 5-yr recurrence-free probability was 54% (95% CI, 44-63%). Clinical local recurrence occurred in only one patient who also had bone metastases. Overall, there were 16 prostate cancer-specific deaths and 19 deaths from other causes. The 5-yr cumulative incidence of death from prostate cancer was 4% (95% CI, 2-11%). Pre-SP serum PSA level and biopsy Gleason score were significantly associated with death due to prostate cancer (p<0.0005 and p=0.002, respectively). This study is retrospective and included carefully selected patients treated over a long period by, mainly, two experienced surgeons. CONCLUSIONS: SP provides excellent local cancer control; only one patient in our series experienced a clinical local recurrence. Earlier identification of patients with persistent, viable local cancer despite radiation therapy will appropriately select patients for SP","","","","","","S0302-2838(08)00828-2 [pii];10.1016/j.eururo.2008.07.007 [doi]","Division of Urology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021, USA","PM:18639970","","","",""

Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 343 patients with prostate cancer treated with CAB from 2000 to 2005. We determined the nadir PSA level that predicts progression to hormone refractory prostate cancer (HRPC) at 24 months after CAB. Predictive factors for failing to achieve a determined nadir PSA were analyzed. Results: Mean age was 74.0 years. Mean follow up was 42.1 month. Seventy-seven patients experienced progression to HRPC. A nadir PSA of 1.0 ng/mL predicts progression to HRPC at 24 months. Predictive factors for failing to achieve a nadir PSA of 1.0 ng/mL or less include pretreatment PSA, percentage positive biopsy core, Gleason score, serum hemoglobin, stage, and extent of bone metastasis in univariate analysis. Pretreatment PSA (>50 ng/mL) and serum hemoglobin (<12 g/dL) were significant factors to predict failing to achieve a nadir PSA of 1.0 ng/mL or less in logistic regression analysis. Conclusions: A nadir PSA of 1.0 ng/mL can predict progression to HRPC after CAB. Pretreatment PSA and serum hemoglobin are significant predictors of failing to achieve a nadir PSA of 1.0 ng/mL or less.

Within the family of BPs there are more similarities in pharmacologic effects than differences, although side effect profiles, rates of oral absorption, and potency do differ. Oral clodronate and intravenous pamidronate reduce skeletal complications in patients with bone metastases from breast carcinoma (as well as in myeloma). Uncontrolled trials of prostate carcinoma also suggest clinical benefit. METHODS: Animal studies show that BPs can reduce the rate of development of bone metastases (for example, in Walker 256 carcinoma), but there is little evidence of an effect at nonosseous sites. The hypothesis that the growth of subclinical osseous metastases is augmented by products of bone resorption (a 'vicious cycle') and may be diminished by a local reduction of these substances has led to trials of BPs involving patients with no clinical evidence of bone metastases. These trials are critically assessed in this review. RESULTS: In patients with recurrent breast carcinoma but no overt bone metastases, oral clodronate reduced the number of diagnosed bone metastases; but the number of patients who had relapses in bone, though smaller, was not significantly different from the number among patients who took placebo. In a trial of oral pamidronate, no effect was seen, but compliance was a problem because of gastrointestinal side effects. Patients treated for operable breast carcinoma have four or five times the normal rate of vertebral fracture, and BPs do reduce the rate of bone loss. Three adjuvant clodronate trials have been reported. The first, an open-label controlled trial (Diel et al.), showed a reduction in osseous and nonosseous recurrences and an increase in disease free and overall survival with 2 years of clodronate. A second open-label trial (Saarto et al.) of similar size involving lymph node positive breast carcinoma patients showed no effect on the rate of bone metastasis relapse and a deleterious effect on relapse rates of nonosseous metastases with 3 years of clodronate. A third placebo-controlled trial involving 1079 patients reported, in an interim analysis, a reduction in osseous metastases during treatment with 2 years of clodronate, but no effect on nonosseous metastases or survival. CONCLUSIONS: A confirmatory clinical trial is required for two interrelated reasons: 1) scientifically, it is important to demonstrate that an agent that has its dominant effect on a normal tissue cell, the osteoclast, can influence the growth of neoplastic cells; and 2) from the perspective of patient care, it must be unequivocally shown that a reduction in the rate of osseous recurrence translates into an improvement in disease free survival or an improvement in quality of life through reduction of adverse skeletal events.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the specific and overall long-term survival of patients operated despite a PSA greater than 40 ng/ml and to describe the adjuvant treatments associated with the surgical procedure. MATERIALS: From 1988 to 1998, 32 consecutive patients with a mean age of 65 years (range: 46-73) underwent retropubic radical prostatectomy. The preoperative work-up (abdominopelvic CT scan, bone scintigraphy) were all interpreted as being normal. All patients had lymph node dissection. Progression was defined by PSA greater than or equal to 0.2 ng/ml or the appearance of metastases. RESULTS: The mean follow-up was 117 months (range: 2-177). Six patients were alive without progression, and five of them had received adjuvant radiotherapy. Twelve patients were alive with biological progression after second- or third-line treatment. Three patients had died from their cancer and 12 had died from another cause. With a mean follow-up of 10 years, the specific survival of patients operated for high PSA was 80% and the overall survival was 56% with a progression-free survival of 18.7%. CONCLUSION: In rigorously selected patients, radical prostatectomy for high PSA possibly associated with adjuvant radiotherapy can achieve satisfactory prostate cancer control at 10 years for almost 20% of N0M0 patients","","","","","","S1166-7087(08)00116-4 [pii];10.1016/j.purol.2008.03.016 [doi]","Service d'urologie-transplantation, CHU Sud d'Amiens, avenue Rene-Laennec-Salouel, 80054 Amiens cedex 1, France. paul.alex@hotmail.com","PM:18538275","","","",""

(daily on days 1 to 7) every 3 weeks for 12 cycles. Patients with osseous metastases received zoledronic acid of 4 mg every 3 weeks. Low molecular weight heparin was administered on a prophylaxis basis to all patients. RESULTS: A prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response > or = 50% from baseline was obtained in 29 (56%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 42-70%) patients. Objective responses among the 25 patients with measurable disease were observed in 48% (95% CI, 27-69%), including 1 patient with complete response (CR) and 11 patients with partial response (PR). Patients with extraosseous only, skeletal only, and extraosseous and skeletal metastases showed different PSA responses (87% vs. 44% vs. 59%, respectively, p = 0.094). Furthermore, patients with soft tissue disease only showed insignificantly better PSA response than those with skeletal metastases (response rate: 87% vs. 50%, p = 0.064). The median progression-free survival was 7.6 months (95% CI, 6.7-8.4 months) and the median overall survival was 18.2 months (95% CI, 15.5-20.8 months). The only parameters which were found to have an impact on survival were the extent of disease and the baseline levels of PSA. Toxicity was generally mild except for myelotoxicity. Neutropenia grade 3/4 was recorded in 33% of patients and 6% experienced febrile neutropenia. Anemia and thrombocytopenia grade 3 or 4 were not a problem. Three patients (6%) developed grade 3 sensory neuropathy and 2 patients (4%) developed grade 3 fatigue. Edema grade 3 occurred in 1 (2%) patient and thromboembolism grade 3 occurred in 2 (4%) patients.

In the majority of cases, prostate cancer metastases to the skeleton, in which case cancer-related bone pain becomes a major cause of morbidity. Androgen ablation is the treatment of choice for securing regression of skeletal metastases in the majority of cases. Intermittent androgen ablation is an attractive alternative, aimed at minimising adverse effects of hormone deprivation but also potentially delaying hormone-refractoriness. The development of hormone-refractoriness is heralded by a significant increase in morbidity largely because of escalating bone pain caused by the progression of the metastatic process. Skillful use of analgesics is initially successful but eventually fails to control symptoms. Localised metastases are best treated with local radiotherapy that is rapidly effective. Over the last few years, it has become clear that therapeutic modalities using bone-seeking radionuclides or bisphosphonates have been effective in the palliation of prostate cancer-related bone pain, although not affecting survival. The main limiting factor with the use of radionuclides is bone marrow suppression, also a feature of the very late stages of prostate cancer. Bisphosphonates do not carry this disadvantage. Results of large double-blind, placebo-controlled studies should be awaited, however, before advocating the widespread use of these agents in the management of patients with prostate cancer and skeletal metastases","","","","","","181202 [pii]","Department of Urology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands. r.c.m.pelger@lumc.nl","PM:11888345","","","",""

In advanced disease, although patients can experience considerable pain and discomfort from bony lesions, they also can experience bothersome fatigue and sleep disturbances from institution of hormone ablation therapy. In localized disease, although patients can have lower urinary tract sym ptoms from untreated prostate cancer, all aggressive treatments can result in urinary, sexual, and bowel dysfunction that can bother the patient and affect quality of life. Patients and providers must be vigilantly aware of the physical burden of prostate cancer when initiating treatment for this disease and during follow up after treatment.

Zoledronic acid 4 mg is administered as an intravenous infusion over 15 minutes. In the treatment of bone metastases, zoledronic acid is the first and only bisphosphonate to demonstrate efficacy in patients with a broad range of tumour types and in multiple myeloma. In well-designed trials, a single 4 mg dose of zoledronic acid showed good efficacy in the treatment of patients with hypercalcaemia of malignancy. Zoledronic acid 4 mg was superior to pamidronic acid 90 mg, administered as a 2-hour infusion, as assessed by normalised serum calcium concentrations 10 days after administration. In conjunction with antineoplastic therapy, zoledronic acid was an effective long-term (up to 25 months) treatment for skeletal-related events in patients with bone metastases associated with multiple myeloma or solid tumours. In patients with bone metastases secondary to breast cancer or bone lesions from myeloma, zoledronic acid was at least as effective as pamidronic acid, based on assessments of skeletal-related events 25 months after the start of treatment. In addition, compared with pamidronic acid, the overall risk of developing skeletal complications, including hypercalcaemia of malignancy, was significantly reduced in recipients of zoledronic acid. Compared with pamidronic acid, zoledronic acid reduced the risk of patients with breast cancer developing a skeletal-related event by an additional 20%. Zoledronic acid was significantly more effective than placebo on most efficacy measures in patients with bone metastases secondary to other solid tumours (e.g. lung, prostate) and showed sustained efficacy for up to 15 months. Preliminary data indicate that its efficacy in these patients is sustained for up to 24 months. Estimates of the cost effectiveness of zoledronic acid in the treatment of prostate cancer were consistent with those of other bisphosphonates, and cost-effectiveness ratios were within limits considered acceptable economic value. Zoledronic acid was generally well tolerated, with a tolerability profile similar to that of pamidronic acid and placebo. As with other bisphosphonates, deterioration of renal function has occasionally been reported in patients receiving zoledronic acid and monitoring of serum creatinine is recommended during treatment. The efficacy of zoledronic acid is therefore well established in patients with hypercalcaemia of malignancy and, for up to 25 months, in the treatment of complications arising from metastatic bone disease in patients with multiple myeloma or solid tumours. The clinical profile of zoledronic acid compares favourably with that of pamidronic acid in patients with cancer and zoledronic acid has a more convenient administration schedule with the potential for better compliance. Thus, zoledronic acid is an effective bisphosphonate and is positioned to play an important role in the management of advanced cancer patients with bone metastases","","","","","","64114 [pii]","Adis International Limited, Auckland, New Zealand. demail@adis.co.nz","PM:15161327","","","",""

We report the clinical outcome after administration of Samarium-153 (153Sm), an emitter of beta-particles that concentrates in the areas of enhanced osteoblastic activity. METHODS: Twenty-two patients (median age 73 years) with metastatic, hormone-refractory prostate cancer received a single bolus infusion of SUP 153 Sm (37 MBq/kg). All patients had painful bone metastases to more than one anatomical region, and most had inadequate pain relief to narcotic analgesics. Bone specific pain, analgesic score according to WHO, ECOG performance status, and blood count were evaluated before and up to 28 weeks after treatment. RESULTS: Median follow up was six weeks (mean 14 weeks). Eleven patients died within the 28 week observation period (ten from terminal disease), and four patients had their observation period truncated. Median pain score was 56.3%, 50.0%, and 50.0% of baseline values at week 4 (n = 20), 16 (n = 10), and 28 (n = 7), respectively. A reduction of baseline pain score by 50 percent or more was observed in 50%, 70% and 71% of patients at week 4, 16, and 28, respectively. Hematological toxicity was mild and reversible in most cases. CONCLUSION: Administration of SUP 153 Sm to prostate cancer patients with painful bone metastases offered clinical relevant pain relief with tolerable hematological toxicity","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Specifically, this analysis will address completed cycle characteristics, the concept of prolonged off-treatment cycles, the time to cancer progression, cancer-specific survival and the association between PSA and bone scan changes. METHODS: A total of 102 patients have been entered into this protocol. Treatment was initiated with combined androgen blockade and continued for 6 months or longer to reach a serum PSA nadir. Medication was then withheld until the serum PSA increased to predetermined trigger points based on initial parameters. Each cycle of treatment and no-treatment was repeated until the regulation of PSA became biochemically androgen independent. RESULTS: One hundred two patients have been commenced on IAS with an average follow-up time of 219 weeks (range: 14.5 to 588). Ninety-one patients have completed at least one therapeutic cycle with a total of 188 completed cycles available for analysis. The average time off therapy (percentage time off therapy) for cycles 1, 2, 3 and 4 was 13 months (53%), 11 months (51%), 10 months (47%) and 8 months (45%), respectively. A prolonged off-treatment time of greater than 72 weeks was observed in 33 (18%) of all completed cycles, and was most common in the men being treated for radiation failure stage C. Progression and survival data was calculated for the entire trial cohort (n=102). The average time to androgen independent progression in the 29 (28%) patients who progressed was 194 weeks. Death from prostate cancer occurred in 19 (18%) patients at an average of 258 weeks following treatment initiation. A review of bone scans revealed 22 events of newly detected lesions, all but 2 of which were preceded by a rise in serum PSA. CONCLUSIONS: Longer duration follow-up of a single cohort continues to support IAS as a viable treatment option for men with prostate cancer. This approach affords an improved quality of life when the patient is off therapy, with reduced toxicity and costs. There is a trend toward extended times to progression and death compared to contemporary studies of continuous androgen suppression. Randomized, prospective protocols are currently underway to determine whether survival is affected in a beneficial or adverse way in men with locally recurrent or metastatic cancer","","","","","","","The Prostate Centre at Vancouver General Hospital, Division of Urology, Department of Surgery, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada","PM:12773232","","","",""

METHODS: The data of 141 patients were analyzed to verify the influence of the following factors on survival: bone-alkaline phosphatase, type I collagen propeptide, the carboxyterminal telopeptide of type I collagen, the urinary calcium/creatinine ratio, patient age, Karnofsky performance status, pathologic grade, duration of response to primary hormonal therapy, prostate-specific antigen, hemoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase, and extent of bone disease. RESULTS: When all the variables were simultaneously analyzed using the multivariate proportional hazard model, only Karnofsky performance status (P <0.005) and duration of response to primary hormonal therapy (P <0.0001) remained statistically significant.

hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC) is characterized by prevalently osteoblastic bone metastases which are what mostly affect these patients' quality of life and make the assessment of response to treatment particularly difficult by commonly used criteria. HRPC cannot be cured by any available therapeutic option, and chemotherapy has to be still considered as a palliative treatment. The anthracyclines doxorubicin (Dox) and epirubicin (Epi), alone or in combination with other agents, have been extensively used in the treatment of HRPC, but controversial results have been reported. The majority of reviewed studies reported a pain reduction in >50% of patients receiving Dox or Epi, suggesting a substantial palliative effect by their use in metastatic HRPC. The weekly schedule of anthracyclines seemed to achieve similar results to the 3-weekly schedule but with a better toxicity profile. Although the toxic adverse effects were usually manageable when anthracyclines were combined with other agents, toxicity was severe by a number of aggressive regimens. Docetaxel is today approved for the treatment of HRPC, and must be considered the standard platform on which new agents may be combined. Given that HRPC includes a heterogeneous group of patients with variable rates of tumour growth, the combination of docetaxel with active agents such as anthracyclines may deserve further clinical investigation.

The majority of patients with advanced prostate cancer will develop bone metastases that can undermine skeletal integrity and result in skeletal complications including pathologic fractures, spinal cord compression, and palliative radiotherapy to bone. The early identification of patients who are at a high risk for bone metastases may enable earlier identification and treatment of bone lesions, thereby preserving patients' independence throughout the disease course. Methods: Current guidelines for bone health maintenance were reviewed and PubMed key word searches performe d to identify risk factors for the development of bone metastases in patients with prostate cancer. Additionally, guidelines and consensus recommendations were reviewed to identify bone health issues and their management in patients with early prostate cancer. Results: Current prostate cancer monitoring guidelines recommend bone scans at initial diagnosis for patients with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels >20 ng/ml and in patients with chronic bone pain or fractures. Multiple studies have concluded that high baseline PSA levels, rising PSA despite androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT), and high PSA velocity are risk factors for the development of bone metastasis in patients with prostate cancer. In patients with early prostate cancer, bone loss is an emerging concern, and bisphosphonates have been demonstrat ed to prevent bone loss from ADT. Use of risk factors such as PSA kinetics may optimize screening and enable earlier identification of bone metastases. Conclusions: Monitoring bone mineral density may allow for better preservation of skeletal health in patients undergoing ADT.

In 2010, two new treatments, sipuleucel-T and cabazitaxel, were approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for men with castration-resistant prostate cancer, based upon improvement in overall survival. The progress that has been made in understanding the biological basis of disease progression, particularly the role of the continued activation of the androgen receptor, have led to new treatments that will further improve survival in these patients. Abiraterone, a drug that depletes both intracellular and extracellular sources of testosterone, demonstrated a 3.9-month improvement in survival in patients who failed docetaxel-based chemotherapy. Other drugs targeting the androgen-receptor axis, such as TAK-700 and MDV3100, have demonstrated significant activity in phase 1 and 2 studies, and are currently in phase 3. Agents that target angiogenesis, bone, and novel apoptotic proteins currently are under investigation, either as single agents or in combination with chemotherapy. The challenge for the development of clinical trials will be how these compounds will be sequenced in the future","","","","","","10.1007/s11934-011-0187-z [doi]","Department of Medicine, Division of Oncology, Columbia University Medical Center, 161 Fort Washington Avenue, New York, NY, 10032, USA, dpp5@columbia.edu","PM:21533748","","","",""

We analyzed the management of PCa at 6 Chinese urological institutions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed of 431 consecutive patients treated for PCa at 6 Chinese institutions, including 5 in the divisions of Shanghai and 1 in the province of Chongqing, between January 2000 and December 2004. Tumor characteristics, therapeutic options and patient outcomes were recorded. RESULTS: At diagnosis median patient age was 72 years and median prostate specific antigen was 46.1 ng/ml. Most PCa cases were revealed by urinary symptoms (75.9%) or bone pain (12.8%). PCa was palpable on digital rectal examination in 74% of cases. At least 44 patients (10.2%) had metastases to lymph nodes at diagnosis and 112 (26%) had bone metastases. A total of 236 patients underwent bilateral orchiectomy and 100 received medical hormone therapy, which in 75% consisted of antiandrogen alone. At a median followup of 16.8 months 60% of these patients experienced biological recurrence. Radical prostatectomy was performed in 24 patients as monotherapy or in combination with bilateral orchiectomy. No patient with clinically localized PCa experienced biological recurrence after radical prostatectomy. CONCLUSIONS: The management of PCa in China differs from that in Western countries. To date surgical castration represents standard treatment. Screening detection of PCa could help detect earlier stage tumors and improve the outcome in patients","","","","","","S0022-5347(01)68783-4 [pii];10.1097/01.ju.0000176817.46279.93 [doi]","Department of Urology, Cochin Hospital, Paris, France. michael.peyromaure@cch.ap-hop-paris.fr","PM:16217289","","","",""

Over 60 years ago, Huggins and Hodges discovered androgen deprivation as a first-line therapy for metastatic prostate cancer, which leads to remissions typically lasting 2 to 3 years, but in most men prostate cancer ultimately progresses to an androgen-independent state resulting in death due to widespread metastases. Multiple mechanisms of androgen independence have now been documented, including amplification of the androgen receptor as well as signal transduction pathways that bypass the androgen receptor completely. In 2004, two landmark studies demonstrated a survival advantage in androgen-independent prostate cancer patients utilizing docetaxel chemotherapy, setting a new standard of care for this disease. In addition, treatments with the bisphosphonate zoledronic acid and systemic radioisotopes have also been shown to have palliative benefits in this population. Building on these advances, several new traditional chemotherapeutic agents as well as new targeted therapies are under development","","","","","","55/5/300 [pii]","Michigan Urology Center, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA","PM:16166075","","","",""

METHODS: A multicentre observational trial was conducted between 1996-1998 in order to evaluate the efficacy of palliative radionuclide therapy for bone metastases in a large number of patients. An evaluation was made on 510 patients with prostate cancer and painful bone metastases, treated with a single iv. dose of 89Sr-chloride (527 treatments) or 186Re-HEDP (83 treatments), in 29 Italian Nuclear Medicine Departments. Eighty-one patients received up to five injections, totalling 100 retreatments. Patients were followed up for a period of 3 months-2 years. Results were expressed at four levels of response: excellent, good, mild, and nil. RESULTS: Responses were excellent in 26.4%, good in 33.3%, mild in 21.3% and nil in 19% of all treatments, while good and excellent responses were obtained in 48% of retreatments. No statistically significant correlations were found between response and age of patients, skeletal extension of tumour, pretherapeutic PSA levels, evidence of non-bony metastases, previous chemotherapy and/or external-beam radiotherapy; osteolytic lesions responded worse than osteoblastic or mixed ones. Hematological toxicity (mild to moderate), mainly affecting platelets, was observed in 25.5% of all treatments and in 38.9% of retreatments. No clear differences were found between the two radiopharmaceuticals employed. CONCLUSIONS: Bearing in mind that observational studies can provide just as accurate results as randomised controlled trials, this study confirms the main findings of various limited monocentre trials","","","","","","","Service of Nuclear Medicine, University of Ferrara, Italy. pif@dns.unife.it","PM:11456368","","","",""

Pelvic lymph node involvement also corresponds to locally advanced prostate cancer. Statistical models called nomograms have been developed to predict the probability of prostate cancer recurrence and are also used to define locally advanced patients. Prostate MRI may help to detect an extracapsular extension or a seminal vesicles involvement but remains still discussed. A bone scan, an abdominal and pelvic CT scan have to be performed in order to detect metastases. A pelvic lymph node dissection is recommended in order to adapt the treatment of these patients. Standard treatment for high-risk localized prostate cancer without lymph node involvement is now well defined. The association of both local radiation and a long androgen deprivation (GnHR agonist) showed an overall survival benefit (more than 10%). The radiation dose of 74 Gy is recommended. Other questions are still debating : the optimal duration of the hormonotherapy , the use of the bicalutamide 150 mg instead of GnRH agonists, the optimal radiation dose. Radical prostatectomy is no more considered as a standard treatment for these patients. Since the use of chemotherapy for metastatic patients showed a benefit in overall survival, the place of chemotherapy as adjuvant or neo-adjuvant treatment is questionned in several randomized phase III studies. Sometimes high-risk disease is diagnosed after performance of a radical prostatectomy. A postoperative radiation may be performed in order to decrease clinical and biochemical progression. The use of bicalutamide 150 mg in this situation may have a positive impact too on progression free survival. In case of lymph node involvement, androgen deprivation is the standard treatment with an overall survival benefit. The place of local radiation therapy is still debating","","","","","","","Departement de Medecine, Institut Gustave-Roussy, 39 rue Camille-Desmoulins, 94805 Villejuif Cedex","PM:17845994","","","",""

METHODS: Patients received zoledronic acid 4 mg as a 15-minute infusion every 3 weeks for 1 year. Bone mineral density of the lumbar spine (L2 to L4) and total hip was measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry at baseline and 12 months. Biochemical markers of bone turnover (N-telopeptide and bone alkaline phosphatase) and serum creatinine levels were evaluated at baseline and during the study. Skeletal-related events were assessed at each study visit. RESULTS: Of the 221 enrolled patients, 202 and 221 patients were included in the efficacy and safety analyses, respectively. The mean increase in bone mineral density of the lumbar spine and total hip was 7.7% (P <0.001) and 3.6% (P <0.001), respectively. Decreases in N-telopeptide and bone alkaline phosphatase levels were significant and sustained. The median time to the first skeletal-related event was not reached; 11.9% of patients had a skeletal-related event. Arthralgia (20.4%), nausea (14%), fatigue (14%), and back pain (12.2%) were the most common adverse events. Adverse events due to renal function deterioration were infrequent. The mean maximal change in serum creatinine level from baseline was 0.3 mg/dL. CONCLUSIONS: Zoledronic acid administration for 1 year to patients with hormone-sensitive prostate cancer and bone metastases who were receiving androgen deprivation therapy was safe and prevented bone loss, as demonstrated by significant increases in bone mineral density and sustained suppression of biochemical markers of bone turnover","","","","","","S0090-4295(05)00759-4 [pii];10.1016/j.urology.2005.05.035 [doi]","Department of Urology, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina 27704, USA. polas001@mc.duke.edu","PM:16286123","","","",""

The clinical consequences of metastatic disease involving the skeleton are widespread. This review focuses on the efficacy, pharmacology, and safety when using intravenous biphosphonate such a zoledronic acid for cancer bone metastases. Zoledronic acid is the gold standard for the medical management of metastatic bone disease. The indications for treatment include prevention of skeletal relevant events (SRE), osteoporotic complications, and palliation of bone pain, among others. Zoledronic acid is the only bisphosphonate effective in decreasing SREs associated with bone metastases from advanced renal cell carcinoma and prostate cancer. Regarding prostate cancer, zoledronic acid effectively prevents both bone loss in patients with locally advanced disease receiving androgen deprivation therapy and SREs in men with hormone-refractory or hormone-sensitive metastatic disease. Zoledronic acid has an acceptable safety profile and tolerability, and has been effective at significantly decreasing the incidence, delaying the onset, and reducing the overall risk of experiencing an SRE compared to placebo. It is the only bisphosphonate currently approved for the prevention and treatment of skeletal complications in patients with bone metastases due to all solid tumors","","","","","","","Duke Prostate Center and Division of Urologic Surgery, Duke University Medical Center Durham, NC, USA","PM:18728715","","","",""

The strides made in treating these primary tumors have extended median survival times and thereby increased patient risk for skeletal-related events (SREs), including pathologic fractures, spinal cord compression, need for palliative radiation therapy or surgery to bone, and hypercalcemia. Bisphosphonates, inhibitors of osteoclastic bone resorption that were first established as treatment of osteoporosis, have been shown to prevent and/or delay SREs related to malignancy. The results of a large, randomized phase 3 study comparing zoledronic acid and pamidronate in breast cancer or multiple myeloma patients with osteolytic lesions showed that the incidence of SREs, time to first SRE, and risk of developing a SRE were similar between treatment groups. However, in patients with solid tumors (excluding breast or prostate cancer) metastatic to the bone, only zoledronic acid has demonstrated clinical efficacy. Although bone turnover marker levels, such as N-telopeptide of type I collagen, have been shown to correlate with clinical response, additional studies are needed to validate their ability to predict response to bisphosphonate therapy","","","","","","","Division of Urology, Department of Surgery, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC 27710, USA. polas001@mc.duke.edu","PM:19920919","","","",""

Such surges may stimulate tumor growth, causing patients to experience new or worsening cancer symptoms and potential serious adverse effects, including increased bone pain, urinary retention, and spinal cord compression and consequently delay the therapeutic benefits of agonist therapy.

It has been shown that the primary mechanism of action is inhibition of osteoclastic activity. Accumulating data show that these drugs are useful in diseases with propensities toward osseous metastases. In particular, they are effective in diseases in which there is clear upregulation of osteoclastic or osteolytic activity such as breast cancer and multiple myeloma. Despite the fact that osseous metastases in prostate cancer manifest as osteosclerosis rather than osteolysis, studies now show that bisphosphonates are useful in the management of this disease. In particular, they have demonstrated an impact on osteoporosis associated with hormonal therapy, bone pain from metastases, and skeleton-related events from prostatic adenocarcinoma.

Androgen withdrawal is the most effective form of systemic therapy for men with advanced prostate cancer, producing response rates in approximately 80% of patients. The majority of men, however, become refractory to hormonal manipulations and die within a few years. Because HRPC is associated with a median survival that rarely exceeds 12 months, and because there is fear of adding further treatment-related toxicity, many urologists are re luctant to offer chemotherapy to their patients. Even though chemotherapy is not curative for men with HRPC, it may prolong survival and provide palliative effects for some patients. Recent research with newer drugs suggests that prostate cancer may not be as resistant to chemotherapy as previously believed. Therefore, enrollment into clinical trials evaluating chemotherapy in advanced prostate cancer is appropriate. Proper patient selection for chemotherapy is a key role of the urologist because continual care is provided by the urologist, best equipping him or her to direct patients toward appropriate treatment options during the various stages of disease. Caring for a patient with HRPC requires the coordinated efforts of a multidisciplinary team, which should be led by the urologist. (c) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

However, its synthesis is not exclusive to the prostate and it is also produced by other human tissues. Abundant amounts of PSP-94 are produced in normal prostatic epithelial tissue and benign prostatic hyperplasia tissue, while levels of expression are markedly reduced in patients with advanced prostate cancer. These findings suggested the potential of PSP-94 as a therapeutic agent for late-stage hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC). Structure-function studies showed that the antiproliferative, proapoptotic and antitumor effects attributed to PSP-94 can be localized to the region corresponding to a mino acids 31-45 (PCK-3145). Syngeneic and xenograft studies using various models of prostate cancer demonstrated the ability of both PSP-94 and PCK-3145 to reduce tumor growth in vivo. More importantly, PCK-3145 was able to reduce the development of skeletal metastasis associated with prostate cancer. Additionally, PCK-3145 reduced tumor parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP), which is the main pathogenic factor responsible for hypercalcemia of malignancy associated with several cancers, including prostate cancer. The antitumor effects of PCK-3145 were attributed to its ability to promot e tumor cell apoptosis. Collectively, these studies led to the clinical development of PCK-3145. After successful completion of the first human clinical trials in the U.K., PCK-3145 is currently being studied in pilot phase I trials in patients with HRPC in the United States.

There is little governmental regulation over these substances in the United States; therefore, manufacturers can continue to produce their products even when evidence of potential toxicities exists. There is also limited scientific data supporting the efficacy, or lack thereof, for most of these products; however, most patients purchase them based only on the potential that they may be beneficial. Although some of these products show some promise as potential treatments for advanced prostate cancer, the data are limited for the most part, and clinical studies are lacking. However, there is abundant information in the media, the internet, and elsewhe re touting the benefits of these agents. Patients who have advanced prostate cancer have few alternatives in the way of traditional medicine and are especially vulnerable to experimenting with CAM agents because their physicians often have few traditional treatment options left to offer them. It is incumbent upon clinicians who treat patients who have advanced prostate cancer to be familiar with these forms of therapy so that they may better counsel patients about their use.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The following potential prognostic factors were investigated retrospectively in 1,852 patients irradiated for MSCC: age, sex, performance status, primary tumor, interval between tumor diagnosis and MSCC (< or = 15 v > 15 months), number of involved vertebrae (one to two v > or = three), other bone metastases, visceral metastases, pretreatment ambulatory status, time of developing motor deficits before radiotherapy (faster, 1 to 14 v slower, > 14 days), and radiation schedule (short-course v long-course radiotherapy). RESULTS: On univariate analysis, improved local control of MSCC was associated significantly with favorable histology (breast cancer, prostate cancer, lymphoma/myeloma), no visceral metastases, and long-course radiotherapy. On multivariate analysis, absence of visceral metastases and radiation schedule maintained significance. On univariate analysis, improved survival was associated significantly with female sex, favorable histology, no visceral or other bone metastases, good performance status, being ambulatory before radiotherapy, longer interval between tumor diagnosis and MSCC, and slower development of motor deficits before radiotherapy. Long-course radiotherapy showed a trend. On multivariate analysis, histology, visceral metastases, other bone metastases, ambulatory status before radiotherapy, interval between tumor diagnosis and MSCC, and time of developing motor deficits maintained significance. CONCLUSION: Poorer local control after radiotherapy for MSCC is associated with visceral metastases and short-course radiotherapy. Long-course radiotherapy seems preferable for patients with more favorable prognoses, given that these patients may live long enough to develop MSCC recurrences. Long-term survival after radiotherapy for MSCC may be predicted if several prognostic factors are considered","","","","","","24/21/3388 [pii];10.1200/JCO.2005.05.0542 [doi]","Department of Radiation Oncology, University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf, Germany.

This study investigated the results of radiotherapy (RT) for metastatic spinal cord compression (MSCC) in the very elderly, because few data are available for these patients. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The data from 308 patients aged > or =75 years who received short-course (treatment time 1-5 days) or long-course RT (2-4 weeks) for MSCC were retrospectively analyzed for functional outcome, local control, and survival. Furthermore, nine potential prognostic factors were investigated: gender, performance status, interval from tumor diagnosis to MSCC, tumor type, number of involved vertebrae, other bone or visceral metastases, ambulatory status, and speed at which motor deficits developed. RESULTS: Improvement of motor deficits occurred in 25% of patients, with no further progression of MSCC in an additional 59%. The 1-year local control and survival rate was 92% and 43%, respectively. Improved functional outcomes were associated with ambulatory status and slower developing motor deficits. Improved local control resulted from long-course RT. Improved survival was associated with a longer interval from tumor diagnosis to MSCC, tumor type (breast/prostate cancer, myeloma/lymphoma), lack of visceral or other bone metastases, ambulatory status, and a slower development of motor deficits. CONCLUSION: Short- and long-course RT are similarly effective in patients aged > or =75 years regarding functional outcome and survival. Long-course RT provided better local control. Patients with better expected survival should receive long-course RT and others short-course RT. The criteria for selection of an appropriate regimen for MSCC in very elderly patients should be the same as for younger individuals","","","","","","S0360-3016(06)02742-8 [pii];10.1016/j.ijrobp.2006.08.011 [doi]","Department of Radiation Oncology, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Luebeck, Germany.

This study investigated the potential benefit of dose escalation. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Data from 922 patients with carcinomas causing MSCC were retrospectively evaluated. The outcome of 345 patients treated with 10 fractions of 3 Gy in 2 weeks was compared with the outcomes of 577 patients treated with 37.5 Gy in 15 fractions within 3 weeks or 40 Gy in 20 fractions within 4 weeks. Additionally, 10 potential prognostic factors were investigated: age, gender, performance status, tumor type, interval between cancer diagnosis and MSCC, number of involved vertebrae, other bone and visceral metastases, ambulatory status, and the interval to the development of motor deficits before radiotherapy. RESULTS: Motor function improved in 19% of patients after 30 Gy in 10 fractions and in 22% after greater doses (p = 0.31). The local control (p = 0.28) and survival (p = 0.85) rates were not significantly different with doses >30 Gy. Better functional outcome was associated with the absence of visceral metastases, an interval between tumor diagnosis and MSCC of >12 months, ambulatory status, and an interval to the development of motor deficits of >7 days. Improved local control was significantly associated with no visceral metastases, improved survival with favorable histologic features (breast or prostate cancer), no visceral metastases, ambulatory status, an interval between cancer diagnosis and MSCC of >12 months, and an interval to the development of motor deficits of >7days. CONCLUSION: Escalation of the radiation dose to >30 Gy in 10 fractions did not improve the outcomes in terms of motor function, local control, or survival but did increase the treatment time for these frequently debilitated patients.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: On the basis of a multivariate analysis of 2096 MSCC patients, a scoring system was developed. This included the five prognostic factors significantly associated with post-RT ambulatory status: primary tumor type, interval between tumor diagnosis and MSCC, visceral metastases, motor function before RT, and time developing motor deficits before RT. The score for each factor was determined by dividing the post-RT ambulatory rate (as a percentage) by 10. Total scores represented the sum of the scores for each factor and ranged between 21 and 44 points. Patients were divided into five groups according to this score. RESULTS: The post-RT ambulatory rates were 6% (24 of 389) for patients with scores of </=28 points, 44% (121 of 278) for those with 29-31 points, 70% (212 of 303) for those with 32-34 points, 86% (315 of 266) for those with 35-37 points, and 99% (750 of 760) for those with >/=38 points. The 3-month survival rates were 29%, 62%, 77%, 84%, and 98%, respectively. The 6-months survival rates were 6%, 31%, 42%, 61%, and 93%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Because patients with scores of </=28 points had poor functional outcome after RT and extraordinarily poor survival rates, short-course RT to decrease pain or best supportive care may be considered. Patients with scores of 29-37 points should be considered surgical candidates, because RT-alone results were not optimal.

Mitoxantrone has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for HRCAP. Preliminary data suggest that DPPE (N,N-diethyl-2-[4-(phenylmethyl) phenoxy]-ethanamine) or tesmilifene modulates cytotoxics to enhance the anticancer effect. In this phase II trial we assessed whether there is sufficient evidence of enhanced efficacy of DPPE and mitoxantrone to lead to a phase III clinical trial. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 29 patients with a median age of 73 years, of whom 10% were older than 80 years, with progressive HRCAP received 5.3 mg/kg DPPE intravenously every 3 weeks, 12 mg/m mitoxantrone intravenously every weeks and 5 mg prednisone orally twice daily. All patients had pain at presentation, while 97% had bone metastases, 10% had liver metastases and 17% had lung metastases. Median prostate specific antigen (PSA) was 210 ng/ml (IQR 77 to 430). RESULTS: Of the patients 75% had some pain improvement, 66% had decreased analgesia, 59% had a PSA decrease of 50% or greater and 45% had a PSA decrease of 75% or greater. Actual (not actuarial) 2-year survival was 21%. CONCLUSIONS: Despite major limitations of historical comparison the PSA decrease and decreased symptoms with DPPE-mitoxantrone-prednisone compare favorably to those of mitoxantrone-prednisone and docetaxel-estramustine in the literature. The 2-year survival rate of 21% mandates further assessment.

There are a number of surgical approaches to manage this condition including open radical nephroureterectomy and laparoscopic procedures. OBJECTIVES: To determine the best surgical management option for upper tract transitional cell carcinoma. SEARCH STRATEGY: A sensitive search strategy was developed to identify relevant studies for inclusion in this review. The following databases were searched for randomised trials evaluating surgical approaches to the management of upper tract TCC: Medline EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), CINAHL, British Nursing Index, AMED, LILACS, Web of Science, Scopus, Biosis, TRIP, Biomed Central, Dissertation Abstracts, and ISI Proceedings. SELECTION CRITERIA: The following criteria that were considered for this review.Types of studies - All randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing the various surgical methods and approaches for the management of localised upper tract transitional cell carcinoma. Types of participants - All adult patients with localised transitional cell carcinoma. Localised disease was defined as limited to the kidney or ureter with no gross regional lymph nodal enlargement on imaging. Types of interventions - Any surgical method or approach for managing localised upper tract transitional cell carcinoma. Types of outcome measures - Overall and cancer-specific survival were primary outcomes. Surgery-related morbidity. Quality of life and health economics outcomes were secondary outcomes. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors examined the search results independently to identify trials for inclusion. MAIN RESULTS: We identified one randomised controlled trial that met our inclusion criteria. The trial showed that the laparoscopic approach had superior peri-operative outcomes compared to open approach. Laparoscopic was superior and statistically significant for blood loss (104 mL (millilitres) versus 430 mL, P < 0.001) and mean time to discharge (2.3 days versus 3.7, P < 0.001). Oncological outcomes (bladder tumour-free survival, metastasis-free survival, cancer-specific survival curves), at a median follow up of 44 months and in organ-confined disease, were comparable for both groups. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is no high quality evidence available from adequately controlled trials to determine the best surgical management of upper tract transitional cell carcinoma. However, one small randomised trial and observational data suggests that laparoscopic approach is associated with less blood loss and early recovery from surgery with similar cancer outcomes when compared to open approach. SURGERY FOR UPPER TRACT TRANSITIONAL CELL CARCINOMA: Upper tract transitional cell carcinoma is an uncommon cancer mainly affecting the draining system of the kidney (kidney pelvis) and ureter (the tube through which urine passes from the kidney to the bladder). The main treatment approach for this condition is surgical removal of the malignant area. There are a number of surgical techniques for this procedure and the aim of this review was to compare them and determine which was the most effective in terms of surgical ease, patient morbidity, clinical outcome and cost. Our search of the literature found no high quality evidence comparing different surgical techniques. Evidence from one small randomised trial and observational studies suggests that laparoscopic surgical intervention may reduce blood loss, post-operative pain and hospital stay. However, the quality of the evidence is poor and, therefore, it is not possible to recommend the most effective surgical procedure to replace the existing clinical practice for managing upper tract transitional cell carcinoma","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of this study was to assess the prognostic value of uNTx for overall survival (OS) and the incidence of SRE in patients with bone metastases from CRPC receiving zoledronic acid. METHODS: From 2004 to 2007, 94 patients with bone metastases from CRPC receiving zoledronic acid for at least 2 months were screened for uNTx. RESULTS: Median age was 66 years (range 46-88). Median serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was 66 ng/ml (0-3984) and median uNTx was 19 nmol/mM creatinine (3-489). During follow-up, 38 patients (40%) experienced an SRE. Median OS was 20 months [95% (CI) confidence interval 15-24). In the multivariate analysis, elevated uNTx [hazard ratio (HR) 2.2 (95% CI 1.2-4.0)], serum PSA [HR 2.8 (95% CI 1.6-5.1)], and ECOG performance status were the only independent prognostic factors for OS. Median OS was 12 months (10-16) and 25 months (21-34) in patients with uNTx > or =20 nmol/mM creatinine and in those with uNTx <20 nmol/mM creatinine, respectively.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Four studies conducted by the Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study (IRS) Group from 1972 through 1991. RESULTS: Favorable prognostic factors are: (1) undetectable distant metastases at diagnosis; (2) primary sites in the orbit and nonparameningeal head/neck and genitourinary nonbladder/prostate regions; (3) grossly complete surgical removal of localized tumor at the time of diagnosis; (4) embryonal/botryoid histology; (5) tumor size < or = 5 cm; and (6) age younger than 10 years at diagnosis. The IRS-V protocols are risk-based and refine therapy by reducing exposure to cyclophosphamide and radiation therapy (XRT) in patients at low risk while adding new, active agents such as topotecan or irinotecan to the standard therapy of vincristine, actinomycin D, and cyclophosphamide (VAC) plus XRT for patients with unfavorable histology or advanced disease. Collection of biologic specimens from patients with newly diagnosed disease continues to identify other factors that may distinguish patients with favorable features from those who need more intensive therapy. A new protocol that takes into account their previous treatment is needed for patients with recurrent disease. This program (being planned) does not include bone marrow/stem cell reconstitution because this strategy has thus far failed to improve survival rates of patients with metastases at diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Better understanding of biologic differences and new, active agents are needed to improve outcome of patients with unfavorable features at presentation","","","","","","","Department of Clinical Pediatrics, University of Texas M.

In accordance with the results of adjuvant antiestrogen therapy in breast cancer early antiandrogen therapy seems to be reasonable to reduce mortality and progression in prostate cancer. Patients & methods: The efficacy and tolerability of the non-steroidal antiandrogen bicalutamide 150 mg once daily as immediate therapy or as adjuvant to therapy of curative intent in localized or locally advanced prostate cancer has been evaluated in a program of 3 prospective double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trials including 8113 patients worldwide. Objective disease progression was determined by bone scan, CT scan, MRI, ultrasound or biopsy. Death of any cause was counted as objective progression. Results: At a median follow-up of 3 years, bicalutamide significantly reduced the risk of disease progression by 42% compared to placebo, 11% of all patients experiencing progression at that point. This positive effect was seen across the entire patient population, regardless of underlying therapy or disease stage. The incidence of bone metastases was reduced by 33%, the risk of PSA progression by 59%. The most frequently reported side effects were gynecomastia and/or breast pain (altogether 86%). S urvival data is still immature with 6% overall mortality and less than 2% patients dying of prostate cancer. Conclusion: Bicalutamide 150 mg once daily significantly reduces the risk of disease progression when used as immediate therapy either alone or in addition to standard care in both localized and locally advanced disease. In more than 3/4 of the patients it is associated with the development of gynecomastia and/or breast pain","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nevertheless, chemotherapy for hormone-refractory prostatic carcinoma (HRPC) has shown some advantages compared with the best supportive care. In a prospective phase II study, we evaluated the combination of epirubicin (E), mitomycin C (MMC), and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in patients with HRPC. Twenty-eight patients with HRPC were treated with a combination of E (30 mg/m2), 5-FU (750 mg/m2), and MMC (5 mg/m2) day 1 and 2, every 4 weeks. Treatment was continued until evidence of disease progression or excessive toxicity. Patients were monitored with serial measurements of prostate-specific antigen (PSA). Forty-seven percent of the patients exhibited a reduction of serum PSA concentration and an objective response; 38% exhibited disease stability, and 15% had disease progression. Toxicity was substantial. The median time to progression was 7.3 months (range, 1.7-16.8 months) and median survival was 14.5 months (range, 1.6-38.4 months). Performance status improved in 80% of patients, and bone pain was relieved in 70%. Thus the combination of E, MMC, and 5-FU shows activity in the treatment of HRPC, giving substantial palliation of symptoms. In one patient, PSA values remained low even when the tumor had progressed","","","","","","","Divisione di Oncologia, Ospedale Civile di Avezzano, Fondazione Ferri-C.R.O.F.I, Monterotonto, Rome, Italy","PM:11404491","","","",""

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis alongside a multinational clinical trial of zoledronic acid. Cost estimation was based on prospectively collected resource use data for 85.3% of enrolled patients. Cost-effectiveness ratios were based on within-trial data on clinical outcomes, quality of life and study medication cost. RESULTS: Patients receiving zoledronic acid experienced fewer hospital days during a mean followup of 9 months (average 5.6 vs 8.0 days; p = 0.1910). Mean direct costs excluding study medication were US dollars 5365 for patients receiving zoledronic acid and US dollars 5689 for patients receiving placebo, a difference of US dollars 324 (95% CI US dollars 1781 to US dollars 1146). The global average cost of zoledronic acid plus its administration during the trial was US dollars 5677 (US dollars 450 per dose). The nominal cost per skeletal complication avoided was US dollars 112300 (95% CI US dollars 6900 to US dollars 48700) and the cost per additional patient free of skeletal complications was US dollars 51400 (95% CI US dollars 26900 to US dollars 243700). Nominal within-trial cost per quality adjusted life-year was US dollars 159200, which varied widely in sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: The nominal base case estimate of the cost per quality adjusted life-year for zoledronic acid in the prevention of skeletal complications of prostate cancer is consistent with that of bisphosphonates in breast cancer. However, the cost-effectiveness ratios for bisphosphonates are higher than commonly cited thresholds for conferring cost-effectiveness","","","","","","S0022-5347(05)62337-3 [pii];10.1097/01.ju.0000116777.94426.60 [doi]","Center for Clinical and Genetic Economics, Duke Clinical Research Institute, Duke University Medical Center Durham, North Carolina, USA","PM:15017215","","","",""

Most patients with prostate cancer, however, will not die of it. As a result, many of them will experience symptomatic metastasis during the course of the disease. Prostate cancer has a high propensity to metastasize to bone. Unlike many other cancers prostate cancer cells induce a rather osteosclerotic than osteolytic reaction in the bone marrow by interfering with physiological bone remodelling. A proper understanding of the mechanisms of tumour cell-induced bone alterations and exaggerated bone deposition in pr ostate cancer may open new and urgently needed therapeutic approaches in the field of palliative care for affected patients. In this review we focus on the central role of two major regulators of bone mass, the wingless type integration site family members (WNTs) and the bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), in the development of osteosclerotic bone metastases","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: Prospective three-arm study: 26 patients (p) with localised PC (LPC); 24 P with metastatic PC (MPC) and 30 healthy volunteer controls. A single 7.5 ml sample of peripheral blood was retrieved; CTCs were isolated using an immunomagnetic method based on the CellSearch system (Veridex). CTCs were identified as nucleated cells negative for CD45 (leukocytes) and positive for cytokeratins. (8, 18 y 19) The relationship between CTC numbers and PSA levels, Gleason score and TNM classification was studied. RESULTS: Only 10% of the healthy controls had 1 CTC/7.5 mL, none of the patients with localised PC had more than 3 CTCs (88% < or = 2 CTCs), and patients with MPC had significantly higher CTC levels [m: 29 (1-178)] compared with the other two groups (P: 0.000). A positive correlation was demonstrated between the CTC count and PSA levels, tumor size, and presence or absence of enlarged lymph nodes. Gleason score was the only parameter that did not show any correlation with CTC levels, and although the number of CTCs was higher in patients with visceral metastases [m: 297 (0-416)] compared with bone metastases patients [m: 68 (9.5-168)] , these differences were not significant. CONCLUSIONS: Immunomagnetic analysis permits CTCs to be enumerated in peripheral blood and could be a possible way to correctly stage and make a reasonable prognosis of metastatic disease","","","","","","","Urology Department, Analisis Clinicos Department, Servicio de Oncologic Department, Hospital Universitario Clinico San Carlos, Madrid, Spain","PM:20157216","","","",""

Because of the increase in life expectancy and prostate carcinoma (PCa) survival, a significant increase in the number of men with hypogonadism who have undergone presumably curative treatment of PCa is anticipated. Despite the widespread belief regarding contraindication of testosterone administration to men with known or suspected PCa, there is no convincing evidence that the normalization of testosterone serum levels in men with low levels presents a deleterious effect on the evolution of the disease. In the few available case series describing testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) after treatment of PCa, no case of clinical or biochemical progression was observed. The available data suggest that TRT can be cautiously considered in selected hypogonadal men previously treated for curative intent of low-risk PCa and without evidence of active disease.

In these phase I studies, paclitaxel was combined with radioimmunotherapy in patients with metastatic hormone-refractory prostate cancer or advanced breast cancer. Experimental Design: Patients were imaged with indium-111 ( SUP 111In)-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-N,Nprime,Ndouble prime, Ntriple prime-tetraacetic acid-peptide-m170. One week later, yttrium-90 ( SUP 90Y) -m170 was infused (12 mCi/m SUP 2 for prostate cancer and 22 mCi/m SUP 2 for breast cancer). Initial cohorts received radioimmunotherapy alone. Subsequent cohorts received radioimmunotherapy followed 48 hours later by paclitaxel (75 mg/m SUP 2). Cyclosporine was given to prevent development of human anti-mouse antibody. Results: Bone and soft tissue metastases were targeted by SUP 111In-m170 in 15 of the 16 patients imaged. Three prostate cancer patients treated with radioimmunotherapy alone had no grade 3 or 4 toxicity. With radioimmunotherapy and paclitaxel, two of three prostate cancer patients developed transient grade 4 neutropenia. Four breast cancer patients treated with radioimmunotherapy alone had grade 3 or 4 myelosuppression. With radioimmunotherapy and paclitaxel, both breast cancer patients developed grade 4 neutropenia. Three breast cancer patients required infusion of previously harvested peripheral blood stem cells because of neutropenic fever or bleeding. One patient in this trial developed human anti-mouse antibody in contrast to 12 of 17 patients in a prior trial using m170-radioimmunotherapy without cyclosporine. Conclusions: SUP 111In/ SUP 90Y-m170 targets prostate and breast cancer and can be combined with paclitaxel with toxicity limited to marrow suppression at the dose levels above. The maximum tolerated dose of radioimmunotherapy and fixed-dose paclitaxel with peripheral blood stem cell support has not been reached. Cyclosporine is effective in preventing human anti-mouse antibody, suggesting the feasibility of multidose, 'f ractionated' therapy that could enhance clinical response.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the prognostic factors of patients treated by first-line endocrine therapy for prostate cancer. MATERIAL AND METHODS: From September 1988 to September 1999, 170 patients receiving first-line endocrine therapy for prostate cancer were included. Endocrine therapy consisted of LHRH analogues alone in 59.4% of cases, complete androgen suppression in 21.2% of cases, antiandrogens alone in 17.6% of cases and oestrogens in 1.8% of cases. Clinical, laboratory, scintigraphic and histological data were collected. The overall survival was studied by univariate analysis as a function of pretreatment criteria using Kaplan-Meier survival curves. RESULTS: The mean survival of the population was 33 +/- 26 months (range: 2-126 months). The following parameters were associated with a significant reduction of overall survival: age greater than 70 years, high ECOG score, mode of presentation of the cancer by alteration of general state, presence of bone pain, presence of bone metastases particularly in the appendicular skeleton, dilatation of renal cavities, Gleason score > 5, PSA level > 100 ng/ml, haemoglobin < 13.5 g/dl, serum creatinine > 105 mumol/l, low plasma testosterone, high alkaline phosphatase, poor response to treatment assessed by PSA greater than 4 ng/ml at 3, 6 and 12 months.

Materials and Methods: We identified 86 patients with bone metastases who were followed between September 1988 and September 1999. Only those treated initially with androgen deprivation as monotherapy were included in this study. Clinical, pathological and radiological information were obtained by patient chart review. The 86 patients were divided into 2 groups according to metastasis grade on bone scan at diagnosis. Group 1 included patients with metastases on the axial skeleton and group 2 included those with bone metastases on the appendicular skeleton. In addition to our classification, we stratified patients according to the Soloway and Crawford et al classifications, and analyzed survival. Results: There were no statistical differences in the groups with axial versus appendicular metastases in terms of patient age, biopsy Gleason score, serum prostate specific antigen or clinical stage. Median survival was 53 and 29 months in patients with axial and appendicular bone metastases, respectively. Those with axial disease had better survival than those with appendicular bone metastases (p = 0.048). No statistical difference was observed when grading bone scan according to the Soloway and Crawford et al classifications. Conclusions: Classifying bone scans according to the site of metastases (axial versus appendicular) had many advantages. It is easy to understand and helps urologist better predict the patient prognosis. Axial metastases carries a better prognosis than appendicular metastasis","","","","","","","","","","","",""

No study has evaluated separately pain at rest and on movement in patients with bone metastases undergoing treatment with zoledronic acid (ZA). Aim: The aim of this prospective observational study was to evaluate the reduction in intensity of pain at rest and in movement-related pain after treatment with up to six infusions of ZA 4 mg every 28 days in patients with painful bone metastases due to breast or prostate cancer cared for at the Oncological Units and Pain Therapy and Palliative Care Unit of the NCI of Milano. Materials and methods: Pain was assessed by a six-level verbal rating scale (0-5 score) at baseline and on each infusion as well as at follow-up visits (2 weeks after every infusion). The two main endpoints (estimated reduction in pain and movement-related pain) were defined as the difference between the baseline score and the average of all the post-treatment scores for each patient. To allow for the potential confounding effect of analgesic consumption, patients without any increase in analgesic consumption during zoledronic acid treatment were also analyzed as a separate subgroup. Results: Forty-eight patients with breast (34) or prostate cancer (14) were enrolled. At baseline, 100% of the patients had pain on movement, in 65% of them, the intensity ranged from moderate to very severe, in 61% of the patients, the intensity of pain on movement was higher than the intensity of pain at rest (average difference 0.89; 95% CI, 0.5-1.30). The estimated mean intensity reduction of pain at rest and on movement was: (a) 0.62 (95% CI, 0.28-0.98) and 0.79 (95% CI, 0.43-1.14), respectively, during the first 90 days of ZA treatment; (b) 0.59 (95% CI, 0.23-0.96) and 0.86 (95% CI, 0.49-1.23), respec tively, during the entire treatment and follow-up period. Analgesic consumption decreased or was stable on average in 31 and 27%, respectively, of available follow-up data. In the 14 patients with decreased or stable analgesic consumption, pain reduction was 0.61 and 1.01, respectively. Conclusions: In this study, at baseline, all the patients with painful bone metastases experience movement-related pain, and during zoledronic acid treatment, a decrease for both pain at rest and on movement was obtained.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1987 and 1993, 2809 patients underwent radical retropubic prostatectomy for clinically localized (< or =T2) disease. In our database, all patients with postoperative biochemical failure (PSA level > or =0.4 ng/mL) were identified. The PSADT was estimated using log linear regression on all PSA values (excluding those values determined after administration of hormonal therapy) within 15 months after biochemical failure. All patients had regular PSA measurements from the time of surgery through the follow-up period. Systemic progression (SP) was defined as evidence of metastatic disease on a bone scan. Local recurrence (LR) was defined on the basis of digital rectal examination, transrectal ultrasonography, and biopsy. The SP-free survival and LR/SP-free survival (survival free of both LR and SP) after biochemical failure was estimated with use of the Kaplan-Meier method. Patients with prostate cancer treatment after biochemical failure had their follow-up censored from this study at the time of treatment. RESULTS: Postoperative biochemical failure occurred in 879 men (31%). The mean follow-up from time of biochemical failure was 4.7 years (range, 0.5-11 years). The mean time to biochemical failure was 2.9 years (median, 2.4 years). The overall mean SP-free survival from time of biochemical failure was 94% and 91% at 5 and 10 years, respectively. The mean LR/SP-free survival was 64% and 53% at 5 and 10 years, respectively. By using univariate analysis on the 587 patients with PSADT data, significant risk factors for SP were PSADT (P<.001) and pathologic Gleason score (P=.005); for LR/SP, significant risk factors included PSADT (P<.001) and pathologic Gleason score (P<.001). In multivariate Cox models analysis, only PSADT remained a significant risk factor for both SP and LR/SP (P<.001). Mean 5-year SP-free survival was 99%, 95%, 93%, and 64% for patients with PSADT of 10 years or longer, 1.0 to 9.9 years, 0.5 to 0.9 year, and less than 0.5 year, respectively; the respective mean LR/SP-free survivals were 87%, 62%, 46%, and 38%. The percentage of patients with PSADT of less than 0.5 year was considerably higher if the type of first clinical event was SP (48%) compared with LR (18%) (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: For patients who have undergone radical prostatectomy, a rising PSA level suggests evidence of residual or recurrent prostate cancer. Many men remain free of clinical disease for an extended time after biochemical failure following radical prostatectomy for clinically localized prostate cancer. The PSADT appears to be an important predictor of SP and also of any clinical progression (local or systemic). These data may be useful when counseling men regarding the timing of adjuvant therapies","","","","","","","Department of Urology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minn 55905, USA","PM:11393495","","","",""

Fourteen patients, median age of 74 years, were treated. The treatment was generally well tolerated with leukopenia and anemia as the major side effects. One patient achieved partial remission and eleven remained with stable disease. One of the eleven patients with stable disease had a dramatic PSA response from 1000 to 236 ng/ml; seven of these progressed after week twelve when vinorelbine was given biweekly. PSA response occurred in 5 of 14 patients. The median time to progression was 28 weeks and the median survival was 17 months. Nine out of the 14 accrued patients were evaluable for quality of life assessment. Five of them improved, three remained unchanged and two had a slight worsening. Four patients had improvement in pain control and fatigue. Our preliminary data suggest that the combination of vinorelbine/prednisone has modest activity in metastatic prostate cancer with a very favorable toxicity profile and is very well tolerated in this group of elderly patients","","","","","","","VA Medical Center, 1201 NW 16th Avenue D1010 (111k), Miami, FL 33125, USA. carlos.robles@med.va.gov","PM:12792740","","","",""

Even though the radiological appearance of such metastases is osteoblastic, it is now known that these lesions coexist in their microenvironment with blastic and lytic lesions. The process always begins with bone lysis by osteoclast proliferation, paralleling nearby bone deposition. The treatment options are palliative and have poor clinical response with short-lived improvement. We have studied the clinical effect of bisphosphonates (clodronate) in the treatment of skeletal complica tions from prostate cancer. Materials and methods: In an open prospective study, 58 patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer with bone metastases were assessed from November 2000 to September 2003. The mean age was 70.3y (range: 51-87y). Bone scintigraphy, plain X-ray, assaying of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and biochemical tests were requested before and following treatment. Patients were previously and subsequently assessed using the visual pain scale (0-10) and Karnofsky's index after the first and second intravenous (i.v.) infusions (administration of i.v. clodronate every 28 days) and every 4-6 months thereafter. Student's t-test was used for statist ical analysis. Results: A total of 53 patients (91.4%) showed improvement after the first and/or second cycle, which persisted for at least 4 months (average 6.3 months). The averages on the visual pain scale improved from 7.4 (range: 2-8) to 2.4 (0-7) and on Karnofsky's index from 43 (32-58) to 73 (50-82). The radiological appearance of the metastases improved in 27 patients (46.5%) and there were few relapses (six patients; 10.3%). Conclusions: Clodronate was effective in the treatment of skeletal complications from prostate cancer. There was an objective response in 91.4% of treated patients, with a marked improvement in the subjective visual pain scale evaluation as well as on Karnofsky's index, with low side effects.

The morbi-mortality associated is usually a direct consequence of metastatic spread to bone, in up to 50% of patients at first presentation. The aim of treatment of metastatic patients is to alleviate and to prevent the distressing symptoms. The approach include hormone-therapy, radiotherapy, radionuclides, surgery, chemotherapy, bisphosphonates and new drugs (agents that inhibit angiogenesis, inmmunotherapy and therapies that affect the differentiation). Decisions about therapy must also take into con sideration the androgen-dependent or independent, so hormone-therapy is the first step of the treatment; the number and location of bone metastases; the severity of symptoms; the available of therapies; the status performance of patient; the prognosis and the cost-effect relationship. Some treatments have established indications whereas others are still in process of study in order to determinate their efficacy, their model of treatment and their indications.

METHODS: Delegates to the October 1998 Royal ANZ College of Radiologists Annual Scientific Meeting were asked to state their fractionation for four hypothetical cases viz. local bone pain from metastatic breast, prostate and lung cancer and neuropathic (radicular) pain from metastatic lung cancer. In addition to demographic data, respondents were asked to select reasons for their choices and indicate what factors would influence a change in their recommended fractionation. RESULTS: Twelve of 32 trainees and 41 of 82 specialists completed the survey, giving an overall response rate of 46%. There was decreasing use of shorter fractionation schedules from lung through prostate to breast cancer with, in particular, single fractions recommended by, respectively, 42, 28 and 15% of respondents for local bone pain (P=0.013). However, the presence of neuropathic pain from metastatic lung cancer led to lower use of single fractions (15%, P=0.0046). There were no statistically significant differences in preferred fractionation with respect to other variables assessed in this survey. The commonest reasons cited for fractionating were desire to minimize recurrent pain and the influence of training, with desire to minimize the risk of neurological progression and optimize tumour regression also important for neuropathic pain. By contrast, use of single fractions was most commonly based upon literature results and patient convenience. Changing from multiple to single fractions was most influenced by poor performance status, while the presence of neurological signs/symptoms had the reverse effect. CONCLUSIONS: The findings from this ANZ survey largely reflect the results from other surveys performed in the UK, Europe, Canada and USA. Although debate continues in the literature, the continuing preference of radiation oncologists to fractionate for local bone pain is contrary to the 16 randomized trials published to date which give little support for a dose-response relationship above a single 6-8 Gy in this setting. This practice has significant implications for departmental workload, costs to the healthcare system and patient convenience. There is no objective evidence on the influence of fractionation for neuropathic bone pain in the literature at present, although an ANZ randomized trial addressing this problem is under way (TROG 96.05)","","","","","","S0167-8140(00)00250-4 [pii]","Department of Radiation Oncology, Royal Adelaide Hospital, North Terrace, Adelaide, South Australia, 5000 Australia","PM:10974380","","","",""

However RT for neuropathic bone pain (NBP), i.e., pain with a radiating cutaneous component due to compression/irritation of nerves by tumor has not previously been studied, and its role is thus uncertain. METHODS AND MATERIALS: In February 1996, the Trans-Tasman Radiation Oncology Group (TROG) initiated a multicenter randomized trial comparing a single 8 Gy fraction with 20 Gy in 5 fractions for NBP with an accrual target of 270. Formal interim analyses were planned at 90 and 180 patients. The 90th patient was accrued in June 1998, and data from the first interim analysis with both arms combined form the basis of this report. RESULTS: Forty-four patients were randomized to a single 8 Gy, 46 to 20 Gy in 5 fractions. The commonest primary sites were prostate (34%), lung (28%) and breast (10%). Median age was 68 years (range 37-89). The index site was spine (86%), rib (13%), base of skull (1%). On an intention-to-treat basis, the overall RR was 53/90 = 59% (95% CI = 48-69%), with 27% achieving a complete response and 32% a partial response. The overall RR for eligible patients was 49/81 = 60% (95% CI = 49-71%) with 27% and 33% achieving complete and partial responses respectively. Estimated median time to treatment failure was 3.2 months (95% CI = 2.1-5.1 months), with estimated median survival of 5.1 months (95% CI = 4.2-7.2 months). To date, six spinal cord/cauda equina compressions and four new or progressive pathological fractures have been detected at the index site after randomization, although one cord compression occurred before radiotherapy was planned to commence. In February 1999, the Independent Data Monitoring Committee strongly recommended continuation of the trial. CONCLUSION: Although these results are preliminary, it seems clear that there is indeed a role for RT in the treatment of NBP. Analysis of outcome by treatment arm awaits completion of the randomized trial","","","","","","S0360-3016(99)00521-0 [pii]","Department of Radiation Oncology, Royal Adelaide Hospital, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia","PM:10705020","","","",""

The Trans-Tasman Radiation Oncology Group undertook a randomized trial comparing the efficacy of a single 8 Gy (8/1) with 20 Gy in 5 fractions (20/5) for this type of pain. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eligible patients had radiological evidence of bone metastases from a known malignancy with no change in systemic therapy within 6 weeks before or anticipated within 4 weeks after RT, no other metastases along the distribution of the neuropathic pain and no clinical or radiological evidence of cord/cauda equina compression. All patients gave written informed consent. Primary endpoints were pain response within 2 months of commencement of RT and time to treatment failure (TTF). The hypothesis was that 8/1 is at least as effective as 20/5 and the planned sample size was 270 patients. RESULTS: Between February 1996 and December 2002, 272 patients were randomized (8/1:20/5=137:135) from 15 centres (Australia 11, New Zealand 3, UK 1). The commonest primary cancers were lung (31%), prostate (29%) and breast (8%); index sites were spine (89%), rib (9%), other (2%); 72% of patients were males and the median age was 67 (range 29-89). The median overall survival (95% CI) for all randomized patients was 4.8 mo (4.2-5.7 mo). The intention-to-treat overall response rates (95% CI) for 8/1 vs 20/5 were 53% (45-62%) vs 61% (53-70%), P=0.18. Corresponding figures for complete response were 26% (18-34%) vs 27% (19-35%), P=0.89. The estimated median TTFs (95% CI) were 2.4 mo (2.0-3.3 mo) vs 3.7 mo (3.1-5.9 mo) respectively. The hazard ratio (95% CI) for the comparison of TTF curves was 1.35 (0.99-1.85), log-rank P=0.056. There were no statistically significant differences in the rates of re-treatment, cord compression or pathological fracture by arm. CONCLUSIONS: 8/1 was not shown to be as effective as 20/5, nor was it statistically significantly worse. Outcomes were generally poorer for 8/1, although the quantitative differences were relatively small","","","","","","S0167-8140(04)00473-6 [pii];10.1016/j.radonc.2004.09.017 [doi]","Radiation Oncology, Royal Adelaide Hospital, 5000 South Australia, Australia. droos@mail.rah.sa.gov.au","PM:15878101","","","",""

Milano,Italy","","<EMBASE/MEDLINE> 2005316179|","","","","","","","AB- Androgen ablation or blockade of androgen action through the androgen receptor (AR) has been the cornerstone of treatment of advanced prostate cancer. The relative merits of monotherapy or combined androgen blockade (CAB) are still the subject of debate. Each treatment strategy/hormonal agent has favourable and unfavourable effects. Patients with advanced prostate cancer will clearly benefit androgen deprivation-based treatment for palliating their symptoms and for improving their quality of life (QOL). However, whether these therapies prolong survival when administered before there are symptoms caused by disease progression remains controversial. Data from multiple recent studies indicate that an earlier treatment in patient's disease course likely leads to better outcome, but it is not easy to predict the best timing of hormonal therapy for asymptomatic advanced disease. For the purpose of delaying the onset of androgen-independent growth of prostate cancer, different regimen of intermittent androgen blockade (IAB) have been applied to patients. The use of IAB is increasing but, despite theoretical advantages in terms of patient QOL, clinical studies have yet to prove superiority over continuous therapy. The role of androgen deprivation in combination with surgery or radiotherapy has been also evaluated. While neoadjuvant hormonal therapy (NHT) can significantly decrease the incidence of positive margins at the time of radical prostatectomy (RP), 3 months of treatment is not long enough to have any significant effect on biochemical recurrence rates. The results of studies investigating longer courses (8 months) of NHT are awaited. High-risk patients should be considered for early adjuvant hormonal therapy (AHT) after surgery, as they may be most likely to benefit. The rationale for the use of NHT in combination with radiotherapy is that it reduces tumour volume and therefore the amount of radiation therapy that is needed to treat the tumour. It has been found that 3-4 months of hormonal treatment reduces prostate volume by 25-50%. Interme-diate-risk patients treated with NHT and concomitant hormonal therapy have been found to have a 94% freedom for biochemical failure after 4 years, suggesting that this group is the ideal patient population to receive short-term hormonal therapy in combination with brachytherapy. Several studies suggested the current consensus that patients with clinically localized or locally advanced high-grade tumours benefit from definitive radiation therapy and long-term AHT. The current treatment for advanced prostate cancer remains essentially palliative. However, an increased understanding of the heterogeneous nature of the disease, the mechanisms that lead to hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC) has identified novel therapeutic targets and led to the development of selective new therapies, that may help to prolong survival and maintain QOL for patients with HRPC","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, until recently no bisphosphonate had demonstrated efficacy in patients with osteoblastic lesions, which are common during the progression of prostate cancer and other solid tumors. Zoledronic acid, a potent, new-generation, nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate, has demonstrated significant benefits for patients with bone metastases resulting from a broad range of primary tumors, including multiple myeloma and breast, lung, kidney, and prostate cancers, and other solid tumors. Benefits include a decreased incidence of pathologic fractures and longer time to the first skeletal complication.

Bisphosphonates are widely used in the treatment of bone metastases associated with breast cancer and multiple myeloma, but have not been extensively investigated in the treatment of patients with solid tumors other than breast or prostate cancer. However, a new-generation nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate, zoledronic acid, has shown significant clinical benefits in indications in which other bisphosphonates have failed. In a phase III clinical trial in patients with bone metastases from solid tumors other than breast or prostate cancer, treatment with zoledronic acid (4 mg via 15-minute infusion) was well tolerated and significantly decreased the incidence of skeletal-related events and increased the time to first skeletal-related event compared with placebo-treated patients.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to receive zoledronic acid (4 or 8 mg) or placebo every 3 weeks for 9 months, with concomitant antineoplastic therapy. The 8-mg dose was reduced to 4 mg (8/4-mg group). The primary efficacy analysis was proportion of patients with at least one skeletal-related event (SRE), defined as pathologic fracture, spinal cord compression, radiation therapy to bone, and surgery to bone. Secondary analyses (time to first SRE, skeletal morbidity rate, and multiple event analysis) counted hypercalcemia as an SRE. RESULTS: Among 773 patients with bone metastases from lung cancer or other solid tumors, the proportion with an SRE was reduced in both zoledronic acid groups compared with the placebo group (38% for 4 mg and 35% for 8/4 mg zoledronic acid v 44% for the placebo group; P =.127 and P =.023 for 4-mg and 8/4-mg groups, respectively). Additionally, 4 mg zoledronic acid significantly increased time to first event (median, 230 v 163 days for placebo; P =.023), an important end point in this poor-prognosis population, and significantly reduced the risk of developing skeletal events by multiple event analysis (hazard ratio = 0.732; P =.017). Zoledronic acid was well tolerated; the most common adverse events in all treatment groups included bone pain, nausea, anemia, and vomiting.

In the current study, they update these results and report the long-term efficacy and safety of 21 months of treatment with zoledronic acid in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial. METHODS: A total of 773 patients were randomized to receive zoledronic acid (4 mg or 8 mg) or placebo via a 15-minute infusion every 3 weeks for 21 months. The 8-mg dose later was reduced to 4 mg (8/4-mg group). The primary efficacy endpoint was the percentage of patients at 21 months with >/= 1 skeletal-related event (SRE) (pathologic fracture, spinal cord compression, radiation therapy to bone, or surgery to bone). Secondary analyses (time to first SRE, annual incidence of SREs, and multiple-event analysis) included hypercalcemia of malignancy. RESULTS: Fewer patients treated with zoledronic acid developed at least 1 SRE at 21 months compared with patients treated with placebo (39% of those treated at the 4-mg dose [P =0.127] and 36% of those treated at the 8/4-mg dose [P = 0.023], compared with 46% of those treated with placebo). Furthermore, 4 mg of zoledronic acid significantly delayed the median time to first SRE (236 days with 4 mg vs. 155 days with placebo; P = 0.009) and significantly reduced the annual incidence of SREs (1.74 per year with the 4-mg dose vs. 2.71 per year with placebo; P = 0.012). Moreover, the 4-mg dose of zoledronic acid was found to reduce the risk of developing a skeletal event by 31% (hazard ratio of 0.693; P = 0.003). Zoledronic acid was found to be well tolerated with long-term use; the most commonly reported adverse events in all treatment groups included bone pain and the transient, acute-phase reactions of nausea, anemia, and emesis.

With the widespread use of PSA (prostate specific antigen), recurrent disease after local treatment for localised prostate cancer is usually diagnosed long before evidence of metastatic disease. In many cases, hormonal manipulations are started at the time of biochemical relapse and therefore, patients become 'hormone refractory' earlier in the course of their disease, frequently with a good performance status, often with no evidence of metastatic disease, and they still face a considerably long life expectancy. Despite these changes, the need for more options in the treatment of HRPC is obvious. The pharmacological treatments that are in use and those that are under investigation for this group of patients will be discussed and include: cytotoxic agents including the microtubule inhibitors, alone and in combination with other conventional or experimental therapies such as calcitriol or thalidomide; treatment with epothilone analogues; endothelin receptor antagonists; palliative therapy with bisphosphonates, bone-targeted radiopharmaceuticals and other developing treatments such as vaccines, gene therapies and monoclonal antibodies","","","","","","10.1517/14656566.4.6.875 [doi]","Division of Medical Oncology, Room 1M-89, Cancer Research Building, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, 1650 Orleans Street Baltimore, Maryland 21231, MD 410-502-9746, USA","PM:12783585","","","",""

However, optimal chemotherapy for HRPC remains poorly defined. This pilot study examined the activity and toxicity of oral 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in combination with eniluracil for the treatment of patients with HRPC. Materials and Methods: Eighteen patients with HRPC and painful bone metastases were enrolled, although 1 patient was deemed ineligible because of incidental gastric cancer. The median age was 69 years (range, 57-82 years), median Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status was 1 (range, 0-2) and median prostate specific antigen (PSA) level was 146 mug/l (range 4-2020 mug/l). Eniluracil (10 mg/m SUP 2) and 5-FU (1 mg/m SUP 2) were given orally, twice daily, for 28 days in 35-day cycles. Results: Two patients (11%) had partial pain responses (95% confidence interval, 0-29%), and 6 patients (35%) had stable pain for a minimum of 8 weeks. A reduction in analgesic use occurred in four patients (23%), and five patients (29%) experienced stable analgesic use. A partial PSA response (>50% reduction on at least two occasions, 5 weeks apart) was achieved in three patients (18%), and eight patients (48%) had stable PSA responses (PSA was rising pretreatment). Grade 4 diarrhea occurred in one patient. Grade 3 toxicities were as follows: anemia, 1 patient; lethargy, 1 patient; and deterioration in liver function, 1 patient. Conclusions: Oral eniluracil/5-FU is well tolerated in this patient population but has only modest activity.

Multiple treatment options exist, including secondary hormonal manipulations, chemotherapy, experimental options, and best supportive care. Choosing the appropriate therapy for an individual patient depends on several important clinical factors such as the presence or absence of symptomatic metastatic disease, age and comorbidities, and prostate-specific antigen velocity. While only docetaxel (Taxotere)-based chemotherapy has been proven to improve survival in this setting, a wide range of therapies may be effective for any individual. Palliative maneuvers, such as external-beam radiation, bisphosphonate therapy, radiopharmaceuticals, and pain management are critical for appropriate patient management.

late-stage hormone (androgen) refractory prostate cancer. Although chemotherapy offers palliation to these late-stage patients, it also leads to systemic toxicities leading to poor quality of life. Clearly, the focus is on the development and evaluation of novel biologically relevant alternatives such as cytoreductive gene-directed enzyme prodrug therapy (GDEPT). With the current limitations of effective gene delivery in vivo, the in situ amplification of cytotoxicity due to bystander effects of GDEPT has special attraction for patients with prostate cancer, the prostate being dispensable. This review focuses on the development, application and potential of various GDEPTs for treating prostate cancer. The current status of research related to the issues of enhancement of in situ GDEPT delivery and prostate cancer-specific targeting of vectors (especially viral vectors) is assessed. Finally, the scope and progress of synergies between GDEPT and other treatment modalities, both traditional and alternate, are discussed. (c) 2006 Informa UK Ltd","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Interestingly, it also functions in the growth and progression of various tumors. Several researchers have identified the blockade of the ET-1 receptor as a promising therapeutic approach. Areas covered in this review: The clinical investigation of an orally bioavailable ET antagonist, atrasentan, in prostate cancer, is encouraging. In this neoplasia, it has shown antitumor activity, bone metastasis control and amelioration of cancer-related pain but improvement in time to progression and overall survival has still not been demonstrated. The clinical trials of other ET antagonists are reported. Literature research was performed by Pubmed and Pharmaprojects. What the reader will gain: A comprehensive view about the use of atrasentan in the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is provided together with the scientific rationale based on the function of ET and its receptor in various cancer development mechanisms. Take home message: Atrasentan seems to be active in CRPC, although strong scientific evidence is still to be found. Interesting clinical findings regard zibotentan.

We systematically reviewed recent publications that report on the use of androgen deprivation (AD) in nonmetastatic prostate cancer patients from the 2003 and 2004 proceedings of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, the 2003 and 2004 proceedings of the American Urological Association as well as published literature from 2003 to 2005. Five recently published mature randomized trials of AD plus local therapy were evaluated plus two large data sets on the use of AD for patients with serologic relapse after local therapy. Four mature randomized studies demonstrate an overall survival benefit to the use of AD in conjunction with definitive local therapy (three with radiation and one with surgery). One retrospective analysis suggests that AD administered early after serologic progression improves overall survival, and one retrospective analysis shows a reduction in metastasis-free survival but has not yet shown an overall survival benefit. For patients with nonmetastatic prostate cancer with high-risk features, as well as those for serologic relapse, the use of AD before the development of metastatic disease is supported by long-term outcomes from a series of clinical trials. Consideration of AD is therefore warranted early in the clinical course of high-risk patients","","","","","","23/32/8225 [pii];10.1200/JCO.2005.03.5311 [doi]","UCSF Comprehensive Cancer Center, 1600 Divisadero St, San Francisco CA 94143, USA. ryanc@medicine.ucsf.edu","PM:16278477","","","",""

A consensus panel was convened to review data and propose a strategy for trial design and prioritization. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Published literature on the natural history of nonmetastatic androgen independent prostate cancer was reviewed. A panel discussion was held, focusing on reviewing current and past trials, and the development of research priorities for patients in this disease state. RESULTS: Based on 1 report the natural history of nonmetastatic androgen independent prostate cancer is relatively long but heterogeneous. External validation of these published findings has not been performed. Clinical trial design in this setting is impeded by heterogeneity and lack of knowledge about the natural history, prolonged time to clinical end points, such as the development of metastases or death, and a lack of knowledge about how intermediate end points, eg the development of bone metastases, are related to the long-term outcome, eg survival. In clinical practice a reluctance to use therapies with substantial toxicity as well as a lack of outcome data on such patients leaves a vacuum in which there is no standard of care, although secondary hormonal manipulations are widely used. CONCLUSIONS: Further research is needed to define the natural history of this disease state, educate patients and clinicians about its distinct natural history and develop informative clinical trial designs suited to this patient population","","","","","","S0022-5347(07)00824-5 [pii];10.1016/j.juro.2007.03.136 [doi]","Department of Medicine and University of California-San Francisco Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California-San Francisco, San Francisco, California 94143, USA. ryanc@medicine.ucsf.edu","PM:17644122","","","",""

METHODS: Treatment patterns at the time of diagnosis were analyzed. Two Cox proportional hazards models were developed, with outcomes of all cause-specific mortality and prostate cancer-specific mortality in patients with M+ disease. Clinical and sociodemographic variables were included in a backward stepwise procedure to identify predictors of mortality. RESULTS: Of 12,005 patients diagnosed between 1990-2004, 284 (2.4%) were diagnosed with M+ disease. After a median follow-up period of 3.8 years, 107 patients (39%) died. Of those who died, 68 (64%) died of causes related to prostate cancer, whereas 39 (36%) had died of causes not related to prostate cancer. The 5-year survival of all patients was 71% and the median survival had not been reached at the time of last follow-up. Approximately 84% of patients received some form of hormonal therapy within 6 months of diagnosis, the use of which increased throughout the study period. Prostate cancer-specific mortality was found to be correlated with the presence of comorbid illness, younger age at diagnosis, and a Gleason score >7 in the primary tumor. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with M+ prostate cancer have a protracted natural history and a median survival that exceeds 5 years. Hormonal therapy is the mainstay for such patients. Comorbid illness, young age at diagnosis, and cancer grade appear to negatively affect the disease-specific survival","","","","","","10.1002/cncr.22736 [doi]","Department of Medicine, University of California at San Francisco Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California at San Francisco, San Francisco, California 94143, USA. ryanc@medicine.ucsf.edu","PM:17516446","","","",""

Zoledronic acid protects against bone mineral density loss when initiated concurrently with androgen deprivation therapy. We evaluated the effect of zoledronic acid initiated subsequent to androgen deprivation therapy on bone mineral density and biochemical markers of bone turnover. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with prostate cancer without bone metastases who had received androgen deprivation therapy for 12 months or less were randomized to 4 mg zoledronic acid or placebo intravenously every 3 months for 1 year. Patients were stratified according to androgen deprivation therapy duration (less than 6 vs 6 to 12 months). The primary end point was the change in femoral neck and lumbar spine bone mineral density in the 2 groups. The secondary end point was the change in serum bone specific alkaline phosphatase and urine N-telopeptide levels. Total hip bone mineral density was also measured. RESULTS: The 120 patients with prostate cancer received zoledronic acid (61) or placebo (59). Compared with placebo, zoledronic acid increased femoral neck, total hip and lumbar spine bone mineral density yearly by 3.6% (p = 0.0004), 3.8% (p <0.0001) and 6.7% (p <0.0001), respectively. The effects of zoledronic acid on bone mineral density at these 3 sites were not differentiated according to androgen deprivation therapy duration. Additionally, mean bone specific alkaline phosphatase and N-telopeptide levels were decreased in the zoledronic acid group (each p <0.0001) and were increased in the placebo group (p <0.0001 and p = 0.004, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Zoledronic acid increased bone mineral density and suppressed bone turnover markers in patients with prostate cancer without bone metastases when initiated during year 1 of androgen deprivation therapy","","","","","","S0022-5347(06)01035-4 [pii];10.1016/j.juro.2006.04.078 [doi]","Division of Hematology/Oncology, Oregon Health and Science University, 3181 Southwest Sam Jackson Park Road, Portland, OR 97239, USA. ryanc@ohsu.edu","PM:16890673","","","",""

We sought to examine the impact of ADT and lifestyle variables on BMD in 120 patients with prostate cancer without bone metastases entering a randomized clinical trial. METHODS: A total of 120 patients with prostate cancer and without bone metastases who had been treated with ADT for less than 12 months were enrolled in a clinical trial of zoledronic acid versus placebo. BMD measurements of the femoral neck, total hip, and lumbar spine were obtained before starting the study treatment by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. The subjects answered a questionnaire regarding possible osteoporosis risk factors, including dairy product use, caffeinated beverage use, smoking history, alcohol intake, calcium/vitamin D supplementation, thyroid medication, and exercise. RESULTS: The median duration of ADT was 3 months (range 0 to 12). Osteopenia or osteoporosis (T score of less than -1) was detected in two thirds of the subjects at one or more measured sites. The mean baseline BMD Z scores were femoral neck -0.091 +/- 0.959, total hip 0.122 +/- 1.005, and lumbar spine 0.657 +/- 1.789. On multiple linear regression analysis, the duration of ADT was negatively associated with the Z score at all three sites and the body mass index, calcium/vitamin D supplementation, and alcohol use were positively associated with the Z score. CONCLUSIONS: BMD loss is a function of the duration of ADT during the first year of therapy. The body mass index, calcium/vitamin D supplementation, and alcohol use were associated with greater BMD, even after controlling for ADT exposure","","","","","","S0090-4295(07)00374-3 [pii];10.1016/j.urology.2007.03.026 [doi]","Cancer Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, Oregon 97239, USA. ryanc@ohsu.edu","PM:17656221","","","",""

Patients received zoledronic acid 4 mg intravenously, or placebo, every 3 months for four treatments. BMD, urinary N-telopeptides of type I collagen (NTX), and serum bone alkaline phosphatase (BAP) were measured every 3 months. In all, 42 patients were randomized. RESULTS: After excluding BMD data from sites of known metastases, patients receiving zoledronic acid had a relative increase in BMD compared with those receiving placebo, of 4.2% and 7.1% at the femoral neck and lumbar spine, respectively. NTX and BAP decreased significantly in patients receiving zoledronic acid. NTX and BAP levels were significantly higher at baseline in patients with bone metastases than in those without.

In particular, pathologic fractures often require clinical intervention and are independent predictors of mortality in men with advanced prostate cancer. Before the introduction of zoledronic acid, bisphosphonates had been shown to provide pain palliation in patients with prostate cancer and bone metastases but were not efficacious in preventing skeletal complications. Zoledronic acid is the first bisphosphonate to show efficacy in reducing skeletal complications associated with the predominantly osteoblastic bone lesions characteristic of prostate cancer. In a large phase III randomized trial, zoledronic acid 4 mg every 3 weeks for 15 months significantly reduced the percentage of men who experienced a skeletal complication and reduced the incidence of pathologic fractures. Additionally, zoledronic acid 4 mg significantly decreased the annual incidence of skeletal complications, including fractures, and provided better control of bone pain compared with placebo. Adverse events with zoledronic acid were primarily limited to the flu-like, acute-phase symptoms previously reported with intravenous bisphosphonates, namely fever, myalgia, nausea, and anemia. These adverse events were mild to moderate and easily managed with supportive care. Zoledronic acid is the first and only bisphosphonate shown to reduce skeletal morbidity, including fractures, in patients with advanced prostate cancer and bone metastases","","","","","","","Department of Surgery/Urology, Centre Hospitalier, University of Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada. fred.saad@ssss.gouv.qc.ca","PM:15046689","","","",""

Patients who develop bone metastases have a high risk of developing skeletal complications, including pathologic fractures, spinal cord compression, and severe bone pain. Bisphosphonate therapy is widely used for the prevention of skeletal complications in patients with bone lesions from multiple myeloma and breast cancer. Until recently, however, no bisphosphonate had ever shown objective clinical benefit in patients with prostate cancer and osteoblastic bone lesions. A recent multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial found zoledronic acid (4 mg) to be a safe and effective therapy in patients with bone metastases from hormone-refractory prostate cancer. Zoledronic acid significantly reduced the proportion of patients who experienced skeletal complications and extended the time to first skeletal complication. Further, zoledronic acid significantly reduced the risk of skeletal complications over this 15-month study and provided consistent reductions in bone pain that were significant at the 3- and 9-month time points compared with placebo. These results suggest that zoledronic acid may become an important advancement in the care of patients with prostate cancer metastatic to bone.

We studied the effect of a new bisphosphonate, zoledronic acid, which blocks bone destruction, on skeletal complications in prostate cancer patients with bone metastases. METHODS: Patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer and a history of bone metastases were randomly assigned to a double-blind treatment regimen of intravenous zoledronic acid at 4 mg (N = 214), zoledronic acid at 8 mg (subsequently reduced to 4 mg; 8/4) (N = 221), or placebo (N = 208) every 3 weeks for 15 months. Proportions of patients with skeletal-related events, time to the first skeletal-related event, skeletal morbidity rate, pain and analgesic scores, disease progression, and safety were assessed. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Approximately 38% of patients who received zoledronic acid at 4 mg, 28% who received zoledronic acid at 8/4 mg, and 31% who received placebo completed the study. A greater proportion of patients who received placebo had skeletal-related events than those who received zoledronic acid at 4 mg (44.2% versus 33.2%; difference = -11.0%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -20.3% to -1.8%; P =.021) or those who received zoledronic acid at 8/4 mg (38.5%; difference versus placebo = -5.8%, 95% CI = -15.1% to 3.6%; P =.222). Median time to first skeletal-related event was 321 days for patients who received placebo, was not reached for patients who received zoledronic acid at 4 mg (P =.011 versus placebo), and was 363 days for those who received zoledronic acid at 8/4 mg (P =.491 versus placebo). Compared with urinary markers in patients who received placebo, urinary markers of bone resorption were statistically significantly decreased in patients who received zoledronic acid at either dose (P =.001). Pain and analgesic scores increased more in patients who received placebo than in patients who received zoledronic acid, but there were no differences in disease progression, performance status, or quality-of-life scores among the groups. Zoledronic acid at 4 mg given as a 15-minute infusion was well tolerated, but the 8-mg dose was associated with renal function deterioration. CONCLUSION: Zoledronic acid at 4 mg reduced skeletal-related events in prostate cancer patients with bone metastases","","","","","","","Uro-Oncology Clinic, Centre Hospitalier de l'Universite de Montreal, Hopital Notre-Dame, Montreal, Quebec, Canada. fred.saad@ssss.gouv.qc.ca","PM:12359855","","","",""

Although the success of current therapeutic options has extended the survival of patients with prostate cancer, they often develop skeletal morbidity from disease and treatment-related effects that undermine skeletal integrity. METHODS: Studies were identified through MEDLINE searches, review of bibliographies of relevant articles, and review of abstracts from scientific meetings. RESULTS: Low bone mass is prevalent in patients in early stages of prostate cancer, although the reasons for this correlation are unknown. Furthermore, androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) by either pharmaceutical (including hormonal) or surgical castration causes significant decreases in bone mineral density. Pamidronate has been shown to prevent bone loss, whereas zoledronic acid has been shown to increase bone mass in men undergoing ADT. Finally, zoledronic acid is the only bisphosphonate that has demonstrated efficacy in reducing objectively measurable skeletal complications in patients with bone metastases secondary to prostate cancer.

Recently, a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase III trial in 422 men with hormone-refractory prostate cancer and bone metastases demonstrated that zoledronic acid (4 mg every 3 weeks) significantly reduced the incidence and onset of skeletal complications and provided significant long-term reductions in bone pain compared with placebo. Patients received zoledronic acid for a 15-month core phase, with the option to continue therapy for 9 more months on the extension phase. To evaluate the continuing benefit of long-term zoledronic acid therapy, retrospective exploratory analyses were conducted based on the incidence of skeletal-related events (SREs; defined as pathologic bone fracture, spinal cord compression, surgery or radiation therapy to bone, or change in antineoplastic therapy for bone pain) occurring only during the extension phase of this trial. Quality of life parameters included assessment with the Brief Pain Inventory. Similar to results reported for the 15-month core phase and the entire 24-month study, the 9-month extension phase demonstrated that zoledronic acid significantly reduced the percentage of patients with an SRE (P = 0.017), prolonged the median time to first SRE (P = 0.036), reduced the annual incidence of SREs by 52% (P = 0.016), and reduced the risk of SREs by 53% (P = 0.022) compared with placebo.

Treatments that prevent skeletal complications in these patients could considerably improve their quality of life. Therefore, this paper reviews the role of bisphosphonates in the treatment of hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC). Published studies were identified through MEDLINE searches, review of bibliographies of relevant articles, and review of abstracts from scientific meetings. Metastatic bone disease in men with HRPC results in skeletal complications such as pathologic fractures, spinal cord compression, and debilitating bone pain. First- and second-generation bisphosphonates, clodronate and pamidronate, had transient palliative effects that were not durable and did not prevent skeletal events in these patients. A small open-label study of ibandronate demonstrated significant reductions in pain, but these results have not been confirmed in a larger, randomized, controlled trial. To date, zoledronic acid is the only bisphosphonate that has demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in skeletal morbidity in this patient population. In a large, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, treatment of men with HRPC and bone metastases with zoledronic acid significantly reduced skeletal-related events and provided a durable reduction of bone pain over 24 months compared with placebo. Zoledronic acid is the only bisphosphonate that has demonstrated efficacy for preventing skeletal complications in patients with HRPC and bone metastases. Therefore, initiation of zoledronic acid therapy should be considered to prevent skeletal morbidity and improve the quality of life of these patients","","","","","","10.1007/s00345-004-0472-2 [doi]","Division of Urology, Department of Surgery, Centre Hospitalier de l'Universite de Montreal, Montreal, PQ H2L 4M1 Quebec, 1560 Rue Sherbrooke East, Canada. fred.saad@ssss.gouv.qc.ca","PM:15666171","","","",""

However, these patients often develop skeletal morbidity from disease- and treatment-related effects that undermine skeletal integrity throughout the course of the disease. Low bone mineral density (BMD) is prevalent in patients with early-stage prostate cancer, and androgen-deprivation therapy by either pharmaceutical agent (including hormonal) or surgical castration causes significant decreases in BMD. Fractures can result in a loss of independence and have been associated with shorter survival in patients with prostate cancer. Zoledronic acid is the only bisphosphonate that has demonstrated objective and long-term benefits in reducing skeletal morbidity in patients with bone metastases due to prostate cancer, and it has produced long-term reductions in pain levels compared with placebo in this setting. Therefore, bisphosphonates, particularly zoledronic acid, may provide important benefits for preserving bone health during the course of prostate cancer progression","","","","","","","Department of Surgery/Urology, Centre Hospitalier de l'Universite de Montreal, Hopital Notre-Dame, 1560 Rue Sherbrooke East, Montreal, Quebec, Canada H2L 4M1. fred.saad@ssss.gouv.qc.ca","PM:16618387","","","",""

To this end, an expert panel composed of urologists, medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, and endocrinologists met to review current clinical evidence for the use of bisphosphonates in patients with different stages of prostate cancer to derive consensus recommendations. Physicians should be proactive in monitoring bone loss in patients receiving long-term androgen-deprivation therapy for prostate cancer. Further study is needed before recommending the routine use of bisphosphonates in men with nonmetastatic prostate cancer. However, if a patient has clinically significant bone loss, use of a bisphosphonate to prevent further compromise of bone integrity should be strongly considered, regardless of hormonal and metastatic status. Bone scans are the preferred method for the identification of bone metastases. In patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer and bone metastases, zoledronic acid is the only bisphosphonate indicated for the prevention of skeletal complications. In conclusion, patients with prostate cancer are at high risk for skeletal morbidity. Bisphosphonates have been shown to prevent cancer treatment-induced bone loss in men receiving androgen-deprivation therapy as well as skeletal complications in men with bone metastases. However, further study of the use of bisphosphonates across the clinical spectrum of prostate cancer is needed","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Available treatment options and study data demonstrating the impact of these skeletal-related events (SREs) on the patient's quality of life are highlighted in this review. Methods: Studies were identified and researched through PubMed. Results: Pathologic fractures affect many aspects of a patient's quality of life. Many of these fractures do not heal properly without treatment and require rehabilitation to restore funct ion. In addition, patients may have pain that is refractory to standard therapy. Furthermore, fractures negatively affect survival in patients with prostate cancer. Vertebral metastases may cause patients to have motor impairment, pain, and neurologic complications. Bisphosphonates are able to effectively reduce skeletal complications. Zoledronic acid significantly reduced the proportion of men who experienced at least one SRE over 2 years on study compared with placebo (p = 0.028). Zoledronic acid also demonstrated a s ignificant 5-month delay in the median time to first SRE (p = 0.009). Moreover, men without pain at study entry had a 39% relative reduction in the incidence of skeletal complications. Conclusions: Bone metastases in patients with prostate cancer are associated with skeletal morbidity that may be refractory to treatment and can negatively affect quality of life. Zoledronic acid fulfills the need to reduce skeletal complications and should be considered in this patient population to delay the onset of these complications and improve pain control","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The natural history of prostatic bone metastases is characterized by skeletal morbidity, often producing distressing symptoms for individual patients and reducing patient autonomy and mobility. These bone metastases are usually radiologically osteoblastic, but there is also a strong osteolytic component as evidenced by marked increases in bone resorption markers. Malignant bone lesions can reduce the structural integrity of the skeleton, resulting in skeletal complications such as pathologic fracture, spinal cord compression, and severe bone pain, which adversely affect quality of life. Preclinical and clinical studies have provided insight into the pathophysiology of malignant bone disease from prostate cancer and suggest that bone-directed therapies, including radionuclides, endothelin-1 antagonists, and bisphosphonates, may provide both palliative and therapeutic benefits. Clinical investigations with these agents are underway in patients with prostate cancer to gain insight into the pathophysiology of bone metastases and to evaluate the role of bone-specific therapies in treating and preventing bone metastases.

Bone loss is prevalent in many men with prostate cancer at initial diagnosis, and initiating androgen deprivation therapy results in accelerated bone resorption, leading to bone loss and an increased risk of fracture. These men are also at high risk for disease progression and bone metastases that can result in significant skeletal morbidity, including pathologic fracture, spinal cord compression, and de bilitating bone pain requiring additional therapy. Excessive osteoclast activity plays a central role in the pathophysiology of bone disease at each stage of prostate cancer disease progression. Zoledronic acid, a highly potent inhibitor of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption, has increased bone mineral density in men receiving androgen deprivation therapy and is the only bisphosphonate that has shown statistically significant reductions in skeletal morbidity in patients with bone metastases from prostate cancer. Furthermore, preclinical evidence suggests that zoledronic acid has antitumor act ivity in prostate cancer models. Recently, a treatment algorithm was developed by the 3rd International Consultation on Prostate Cancer recommending the use of zoledronic acid for the prevention of skeletal complications in patients with bone metastases from prostate cancer, regardless of their hormone status, and for the prevention of treatment-induced bone loss in patients without evidence of bone metastases. According to this algorithm, zoledronic acid should be considered for the prevention of skeletal morbidity in patients with prostate cancer throughout their treatment continuum.

We conducted several retrospective exploratory analyses to determine whether zoledronic acid has continuing efficacy during long-term treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This report included analysis of the occurrence of SREs during the extension phase only (months 16-24), analysis of skeletal complications excluding the first SRE at 15 months (core phase), and stratified analysis of patients by history of SREs before study entry. RESULTS: Patients (N=422) were randomized to receive zoledronic acid 4 mg or placebo. For the 132 patients who entered the extension phase, zoledronic acid significantly delayed the onset of first SRE (P=.009) and decreased the risk of developing an SRE by 53% compared with placebo (P=.022). Among all 422 patients, zoledronic acid significantly reduced the incidence of a second on-study SRE (P=.017) and significantly delayed the median time to second SRE compared with placebo (P=.006) at 15 months. Among 144 patients (34%) with a history of SREs before study entry, zoledronic acid significantly reduced the skeletal morbidity rate by 65% (P=.036) and reduced the overall risk of developing an SRE by 40% (P=.028) compared with placebo at 24 months. CONCLUSION: This analysis confirms our previously reported results and suggests that long-term treatment with zoledronic acid provides continuing clinical benefit in patients with advanced prostate cancer, even after the occurrence of SREs","","","","","","","Centre Hospitalier de l'Universite de Montreal, Hopital Notre-Dame, Montreal, Quebec, Canada. fred.saad@umontreal.ca","PM:17956712","","","",""

METHODS: A Cox regression model was used to estimate the effect of fractures (time-dependent variable) on survival in patients with stage III multiple myeloma or bone metastases from solid tumors enrolled in 3 large trials. Patients were randomized to receive zoledronic acid, pamidronate, or placebo every 3-4 weeks for up to 24 months (prostate cancer, breast cancer, and multiple myeloma) or up to 21 months (lung and other solid tumors). RESULTS: A total of 3049 patients with multiple myeloma (n = 513), breast (n = 1130), prostate (n = 640), or lung cancer or other solid tumors (n = 766) were included in this analysis. Patients with multiple myeloma had the highest fracture incidence (43%), followed by breast (35%), prostate (19%), and lung cancer (17%). In all tumor types except lung, pathologic fracture was associated with a significant increase in risk of death, and breast cancer patients had the greatest increased risk. After adjustment for baseline characteristics, including performance status and prior skeletal complications, breast cancer patients who developed a pathologic fracture on study had a significant 32% increased risk of death relative to patients without a fracture (hazard ratio = 1.32; P < .01); patients with multiple myeloma or prostate cancer had a >20% increased risk of death. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that fractures are associated with increased risk of death in patients with malignant bone disease. Therefore, preventing fractures is an important goal of therapy","","","","","","10.1002/cncr.22991 [doi]","Centre Hospitalier de l'Universite de Montreal, Hopital Notre-Dame, Montreal, Quebec, Canada. fred.saad@umontreal.ca","PM:17763372","","","",""

Bone metastases can lead to debilitating skeletal complications and reduced quality of life (QoL). Therefore, the goal of therapy for patients with malignant bone disease is preservation of functional independence and QoL by delaying onset of skeletal-related events (SREs) and by palliating bone pain. Bisphosphonates have become integral in achieving treatment goals for these patients. Methods: Data from two phase 3, placebo-controlled trials in patients with malignant bone disease from HRPC or solid tumors including renal cell carcinoma (RCC) were reviewed to determine the efficacy of zoledronic acid in reducing the incidence and delaying the onset of SREs. Results: In patients with metastatic HRPC (n = 422), 4 mg zoledronic acid every 3 wk significantly reduced all types of SREs, delayed time to first SRE by >5 mo, and reduced ongoing risk of SREs by 36% compared with placebo. Moreover, zoledronic acid reduced the risk of experiencing a second SRE compared with placebo and appeared to be more beneficial in patients with no pain at baseline. In a separate trial in patients with solid tumors, zoledronic acid reduced the proportion of patients who experienced any SRE compared with placebo in the RCC subset (n = 46). Furthermore, zoledronic acid demonstrated trends for longer overall survival in these patient populations. Conclusions: Zoledronic acid significantly delays the onset and reduces the incidence of SREs in patients with bone metastases secondary to HRPC and RCC.

patients, bone health issues remain a challenge throughout the continuum of care. Patients with prostate cancer are at high risk of skeletal complications from bone metastases and bone loss induced by cancer treatments, such as androgen-deprivation therapy. The preservation of skeletal health might require the cooperation of urologists, oncologists, pain spec ialists, and other physicians specializing in the treatment of prostate cancer. Complications resulting from bone loss and bone metastases can result in increased risk of fracture and death. Implementation of a multidisciplinary approach for the management of bone health can, therefore, provide clinically meaningful benefits to patients with skeletal complications. The early diagnosis and treatment of bone loss and bone metastases with bisphosphonates are critical for the maintenance of skeletal wellness and prevention of bone complications in patients with prostate cancer","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: Studies were identified through MEDLINE searches, review of bibliographies of relevant articles, and review of abstracts from scientific meetings. RESULTS: Among patients with bone metastases from prostate cancer or renal cell carcinoma, zoledronic acid significantly delayed the onset and reduced the incidence of skeletal complications compared with placebo. Zoledronic acid is also the only bisphosphonate that has demonstrated a trend toward improved survival and delayed progression of bone lesions in patients with urologic malignancies. Furthermore, zoledronic acid reduced the incidence of pathologic fracture, a skeletal-related event known to be associated with reduced survival. Bisphosphonates have also demonstrated significant palliative benefits, and preclinical evidence indicates that bisphosphonates may have direct anti-tumour effects.

Once this happens, the disease carries considerable morbidity and is incurable. The process of bone metastasis involves a complex interplay between tumour and bone tissue. The eventual characteristic clinical presentation of disorganized osteoblastic bone lesions is preceded by a facilitatory osteoblastic phase; an osteoblastic component then continues to underlie the process. Increasing evidence has shown a ubiquitous role for Src (a proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase) in multiple tumour and bone-signalling processes involved in prostate tumour progression, driving proliferation, survival, migration and transition to androgen-independent growth. It is also intimately involved in positively regulating osteoclast physiology. As such, this molecule represents an attractive target for managing progressing prostate cancer. Encouraging results have been obtained in preclinical and clinical studies using Src inhibitors like AZD0530 and dasatinib. Both compounds reduced markers of bone resorption, in patients with cancer and those with advanced castration-resistant prostate cancer, respectively. Moreover, because Src is central to many mechanisms thought to be responsible for the development of castration resistance, adding Src inhibitors to a treatment regimen might reverse this phenomenon. As a result, many Src inhibitors are in preclinical development. This review explores Src inhibition as a strategy for managing bone metastasis in prostate cancer, with a particular focus on targeting the critical osteoclastic response. Other emerging and novel approaches are also considered","","","","","","BJU8249 [pii];10.1111/j.1464-410X.2008.08249.x [doi]","CHUM, University of Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada. fredsaad@videotron.ca","PM:19154462","","","",""

Bisphosphonates have utility in oncology for patients with bone metastases to prevent bone loss during hormonal therapy and in the benign setting to treat osteoporosis. These agents have an emerging role in patients with hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (HSPC). Etidronate, alendronate, pamidronate, and zole dronic acid have all shown efficacy in preventing ADT-related bone loss. Alendronate and zoledronic acid have also been shown to increase bone mineral density vs baseline during ADT. Patients with bone metastases from HSPC who received 4 mg zoledronic acid every 3 or 4 weeks had a low incidence of skeletal complications, although controlled study data have not been reported. Bisphosphonate treatment in men with HSPC may be effective for the prevention of ADT-related bone loss, underscoring the importance of treating early to avoid SREs and potentially delay disease progression to metastatic bone disease.

This disruption may lead to bone pain and fractures. Improvements in the assessment and management of bone metastases are therefore required. Objective: To assess the value of bone turnover markers, particularly N-telopeptide in urine (uNTx), in predicting skeletal events and the potential of the novel agent denosumab to reduce the secondary disruption to bone in men with PCa. Evidence acquisition: This article is based on a presentation at an Amgen satellite symposium held at the European Association of Urology Cong ress in Stockholm, Sweden, in March 2009. Evidence synthesis: High levels of uNTx in patients with bone metastases secondary to a range of cancers, including PCa, are associated with an increased risk of skeletal-related events (SRE) and death. Denosumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to and inhibits RANK Ligand, currently under development as a potential new treatment for bone metastases associated with a broad range of tumours. Denosumab has been shown to reduce the level of uNTx in patients with bone metastases resulting from breast cancer. Treatment with denosumab also has beneficial effects on other bone markers and the incidence of SRE in these patients. Similarly, denosumab reduces uNTx levels and the risk of SRE in patients with other primary tumours, including PCa. Evidence from an active-comparator study involving patients previously unresponsive to bisphosphonates suggests a benefit of denosumab over continued bisphosphonate treatment. Conclusions: Measurement of uNTx levels may be a useful marker for identifying patients most at risk of skeletal complications. Denosumab suppresses uNTx levels, and trials evaluating the efficacy of denosumab in preventing and treating complications caused by bone metastases are continuing.

Low bone density is common at diagnosis, and fracture risk is further elevated by the effects of androgen-deprivation therapy. Later in the disease course, bone metastases can result in skeletal morbidity. Although prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels can provide important insights into overall disease progression, convenient, noninvasive tools for monitoring skeletal health are lacking. Biochemical markers released into serum and urine as a result of bone turnover might fulfill this unmet need. The objectives of this article are to assess current evidence examining the potential utility of bone turnover markers for monitoring skeletal health, bone disease progression, and response to antiresorptive therapies in the prostate cancer setting. METHODS:: Published articles and abstracts from major oncology or urology congresses pertaining to the use of bone turnover markers to monitor skeletal health and disease progression were identified and assessed for relevance and methodologic stringency. RESULTS:: Several randomized trials and correlative studies support the utility of bone marker level changes to assess disease progression in the metastatic setting, bone health during hormonal therapy, and response to bisphosphonate therapy. The available data support potential associations between levels of the collagen type I telopeptides (NTX and CTX) and the severity of metastatic bone disease as well as outcomes during antiresorptive therapy. Evidence linking bone marker level changes with early diagnosis of skeletal metastases is emerging. Although several markers have shown promising results in correlative studies, results from ongoing prospective trials are needed to establish the role of bone markers in this setting. CONCLUSIONS:: Bone marker levels reflect ongoing skeletal metabolism and can provide important insights into bone health and response to bisphosphonate therapy in patients with prostate cancer. The data supporting a role for bone markers to monitor skeletal disease progression and response to zoledronic acid therapy are especially strong. Bone marker assessments may complement established diagnostic and monitoring paradigms in prostate cancer","","","","","","S1078-1439(10)00223-1 [pii];10.1016/j.urolonc.2010.08.007 [doi]","Centre Hospitalier de l'Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada","PM:21163673","","","",""

Bone metastases can undermine skeletal integrity long before the onset of symptoms. Treating patients before symptom onset might be more effective in preventing SREs and improving patients' quality of life. ZOL has shown significant reductions in SREs and pain compared with placebo in patients with bone metastases from advanced prostate cancer in a randomized placebo-controlled trial. METHODS: Patients from a placebo-controlled, Phase III trial of men with castration-resistant prostate cancer, randomized to receive ZOL 4 mg (n = 214) or placebo (n = 208) for </= 24 months, were stratified by pain or no pain at baseline. Bone pain was assessed at baseline, week 3, and week 6 and at 6-week intervals thereafter. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with >/= 1 SRE. RESULTS: ZOL significantly reduced the mean pain scores compared with placebo at 3, 9, 21, and 24 months (P </= .03 for each point) and reduced the annual incidence of SREs. Among patients without baseline pain, ZOL decreased the percentage of patients with >/= 1 SRE by 39% and reduced the annual incidence of SREs by 49% compared with placebo. ZOL delayed the onset of bone pain in those patients without pain at baseline compared with placebo.

For patients with bone lesions, the goals of treatment are to decrease tumor growth, prevent further metastases, and inhibit tumor-associated bone pathology. Preclinical data suggest that SRC, a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase, is an important signaling molecule during the processes of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption, tumor growth, and metastasis, and that SRC has a role in hormone receptor signaling and resistance. As such, SRC represents a logical target for the treatment of advanced metastatic prostate or breast cancer. SRC-targeting agents, including dasatinib, saracatinib, and bosutinib, are currently in clinical development for patients with solid tumors. Preliminary data from phase 1/2 trials, including tumor responses and bone-specific activity in patients with prostate or breast cancer, demonstrate that SRC inhibitors have potential in the clinical setting. Data arising from ongoing and future clinical trials will confirm whether SRC inhibitors provide clinical benefits for patients with advanced disease.

Bone metastasis frequently results in pain, pathologic fractures, hypercalcemia, and spinal cord compression. Pain can have a devastating effect on the quality of life in advanced cancer patients and is a serious complication of cancer. Although significant advances are being made in cancer treatment and diagnosis, the basic neurobiology of bone cancer pain is poorly understood. New insights into the mechanisms that induce cancer pain now are coming from animal models. Chemicals derived from tumor cells, inflammatory cells, and cells derived from bone appear to be involved simultaneously in driving this frequently difficult-to-control pain state. Understanding the mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of bone cancer pain will improve both our ability to provide mechanism-based therapies and the quality of life of cancer patients","","","","","","","Neurosystems Laboratory, Division of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Department of Diagnostic and Surgical Sciences, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis 55455, USA","PM:15724942","","","",""

METHODS: A total of 200 patients, all of whom had the diagnosis of breast or prostate cancer and had undergone bone scintigraphy, were studied retrospectively. Whole-body images, anterior and posterior, were obtained after injection of 99mTc-methylene diphosphonate. The study material was randomly divided into a training group and a test group, with 100 patients in each group. The training group was used in the process of developing the image analysis techniques and to train the artificial neural networks. The test group was used to evaluate the automated method. The image processing techniques included algorithms for segmentation of the head, chest, spine, pelvis and bladder, automatic thresholding and detection of hot spots. Fourteen features from each examination were used as input to artificial neural networks trained to classify the images. The interpretations by an experienced physician were used as the 'gold standard'. RESULTS: The automated method correctly identified 28 of the 31 patients with metastases in the test group, i.e., a sensitivity of 90%. A false positive classification of metastases was made in 18 of the 69 patients not classified as having metastases by the experienced physician, resulting in a specificity of 74%. CONCLUSION: A completely automated method can be used to detect metastases in bone scans.

METHODS: Bone scan images from 59 patients with breast or prostate cancer, who had undergone scintigraphy due to suspected bone metastatic disease, were studied. The patients were selected to reflect the spectrum of pathology found in everyday clinical work. Whole body images, anterior and posterior views, were sent to all 30 hospitals in Sweden that perform bone scans. Thirty-seven observers from 18 hospitals agreed to participate in the study. They were asked to classify each of the patient studies regarding the presence of bone metastasis, using a four-point scale. Each observer's classifications were pairwise compared with the classifications made by all the other observers, resulting in 666 pairs of comparisons. The interpretations of the 37 observers were also compared with the final clinical assessment, which was based on follow-up scans and other clinical data. RESULTS: On average, two observers agreed on 64% of the bone scan classifications. Kappa values ranged between 0.16 and 0.82, with a mean of 0.48. Sensitivity and specificity for the observers compared with the final clinical assessment were 77% and 96%, respectively, for detecting bone metastases in planar whole-body bone scanning.

We evaluated the activity of the following schedule: EM 10 mg/kg orally daily on Days 1 to 21 every 28 days, docetaxel 70 mg/m(2) IV on Day 2 every 28 days and a total doses of 2150 mg of suramin in every cycle. Treatment was continued until disease progression or excessive toxicity. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 23.4 months. A median of 8.8 consecutive cycles was administered per patient. In the 25 patients with lymphadenopathy, there were three (12%) complete and 18 (72%) partial responses for a measurable disease response rate of 84%. Levels of prostatic specific antigen (PSA) decreased by greater than 50% in 100% of patients and by greater than 90% in 76.2%. The median time to progression was 57 weeks and median overall survival was 132 weeks. A decline in PSA of > or =50% lasting > or =30 days was significantly associated with a prolonged median time to progression and median overall survival. Tumor volume reduction and/or antitumor treatment effects were observed in 88% of patients. A significant decrease in mean pain score from 7.8 (range, 6-10) to 2.2 (range, 0-4) (P < 0.001) was achieved in 78%. Of patients with bone metastasis, 30.5% demonstrated a partial response.

It is likely to result in over 27,000 deaths in 2006, and the average male will have a one in six chance of developing this malady in his lifetime. These statistics illustrate the need to have screening and treatment systems in place that possess both a high degree of sensitivity as well as proven effectiveness. With the recent strides made in the field of molecular and cellular biology, it is now possible to analyze and tailor treatments to an individual's tumor. As the methods of analysis become more refined, researchers are better able to sift through the vast amounts of data and hone in on promising new targets. Molecular prognostic markers are already begi nning to appear as a result of modern genomic analysis, and more are on the way. These markers are appearing in a variety of pathways including signal transduction, apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, angiogenesis, and cell adhesion. The emergence of viable prognostic markers indicative of specific tumor types holds the potential of greatly improving cancer screening methods as well as overall patient survival.

Metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has a poor prognosis and unpredictable course and to date there are no molecular markers that reliably protect RCC outcome. A novel kidney cancer marker, carbonic anhydrase IX (CA IX), was investigated as an independent prognostic factor for survival for patients with metastatic RCC. In patients with non-metastatic RCC low CAIX predicted a worse outcome similar to patients with metastatic disease and overall CAIX expression decreased with development of metastasis. CAIX reflects significant changes in tumour biology, which may be used to predict clinical outcome and identify high-risk patients for adjuvant-targeted therapies. With regard to prostate cancer there are a number of putative biomarkers, although there are limited studies providing clinical correlations in humans. Potential biomarkers include caveolin-1, p-Akt, p27, the met oncogene, Ki67 (MIB-1), 8q24 over-expression, polycomb protein EZH2, plasma TGF-B1 and IL-6 among others. The laboratory has concentrated on the Prostate Stem Cell Antigen (PSCA) which is increased in patients with more aggressive features, that is higher Gleason grade and higher stage. Highest expression is seen in metastatic lesions to bone and staining for PSCA may predict for disease progression or recurrence. Also promising is the finding reported by the group that expression of p27 in radical prostatectomy specimens correlates with biochemical recurrence. Loss of p27 (defined as absent expression in more than 70% of the specimen) is an independent predictor of recurrence among all patients and among the sub-set with organ confined and extra-capsular disease. The data also shows that p27 can predict outcome among patients with positive surgical resection margins. As with other biomarkers, major questions still to be addressed is the requirement for universal application with uniform scoring and the need for prospective studies in randomized clinical trials","","","","","","X8822464V0722742 [pii];10.1080/13547500500215050 [doi]","Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine and Urology, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA. jsaid@mednet.ucla.edu","PM:16298916","","","",""

New uses emerged for these compounds after their effect on mitochondrial function was discovered. Cytostatic and cytotoxic activity of these compounds was shown against cell lines of various tumor origins. In addition, tetracyclines and chemically modified tetracyclines inhibit the activity of several matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Given the importance of these enzymes in tumor cell invasion and metastatic ability, the potential use of tetracyclines in cancer therapy needed to be investigated. Col-3, a chemically modified tetracycline, is now the subject of clinical trials in cancer patients. However, the potential of tetracyclines in cancer therapy takes on an added dimension in the bone. MMPs have been shown to be important mediators of metastasis formation in the bone, contributing largely to the morbidity of breast cancer and prostate cancer patients. The natural osteotropism of tetracyclines would allow them to be highly effective in the inhibition of MMPs produced by osteoclasts or tumor cells in the bone. This hypothesis has now been confirmed by experimental evidence showing that doxycycline reduces tumor burden in a mouse model of breast cancer-derived osteolytic bone metastasis. This effect is likely due to a combination of multiple roles of doxycycline, including MMP inhibition and a negative effect on osteoclast differentiation and survival. These encouraging results have now paved the way for an ongoing trial of doxycycline in early combination therapy for breast cancer and prostate cancer patients","","","","","","10.1097/01.cad.0000099002.92896.cf [doi]","Department of Pathology and Molecular Medicine, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada","PM:14597870","","","",""

After 12 weeks treatment, clinical effects against subjective symptoms (pain, voiding difficulty, performance status and body weight), serum testosterone level, tumor size and serum PSA level were examined to investigate short-term effect of each treatment. The treatment had been continued for 24 months and the treatment effects including progression free survival and overall survival were analyzed.RESULTS: Clinical efficacy after 12 weeks treatment were examined among 97 cases (group I; 35 cases, group II; 36 cases, group III; 26 cases). The background of those patients in each group was statistically equal. Treatment effects against subjective symptoms and serum testosterone level statistically revealed no significant difference among 3 groups. Treatment effects against primary tumor, bone metastatic lesion, lymphnode metastatic lesion and serum PSA level were investigated and anti-tumor effect was characterized by total efficacy rate (complete remission rate plus partial remission rate) of each treatment group. Treatment efficacy rates for each lesion and PSA demonstrated no statistical difference among 3 treatment groups. Total efficacy rate of group I, II and III were 88.2%, 84.0% and 78.3%, respectively, which statistically revealed no significant difference. Total efficacy rate of each group after completing 24 months treatment was; group I 80.0%, group II 55.6% and group III 83.3%, which statistically showed no significant difference among 3 treatment groups. The median day for progression free survival of group I, II and III were 661, 731 and 517, respectively.

Six countries randomized 156 patients (all with WS bone metastases): 51, 56, and 49 patients to Arms A, B, and C, respectively. There were 72 (46%) breast, 50 (32%) prostate, 9 (6%) lung, and 25 (16%) miscellaneous primary tumors. Initial performance status (PS) was 1-2 in 101 (65%) and PS 3-4 in 55 (35%). The lower, upper, and middle halves of the body were treated 79, 68, and 9 times. RESULTS: Pain relief was seen in 91% of patients (45% complete [CR] and 46% partial [PR]) within 3-8 days. Overall (OS), median (MST), and pain-free (PFS) survival was 174, 150, and 122 days. Breast tumors had a higher OS (279 days) than that of other primary tumors, but when analyzed by treatment, was not significantly different than prostate tumors in Arm A. No survival differences were found in patients with PS 1-2 vs. 3-4, CR vs. PR, bone with/without visceral metastases, or by the number of metastases (< or > 15 bone lesions). Quality of life (QOL) assessed by the percent of the remaining life free of pain was 71%; furthermore significant improvements in PS, pain, and narcotic scores were seen after HBI. Toxicity was very acceptable (41% none, 50% mild/moderate, 12% severe but transitory); more was seen with upper HBI. CONCLUSION: In terms of response, time to response, OS, MST, PFS, QOL, and toxicity, schedules for Arms A and C were similar for all but prostate primaries. Schedule for Arm B, which delivered the lowest biologic dose in the shortest time, had significantly worse results in pain relief, OS, MST, PFS, and QOL. Results indicate that, for most primary tumor types (except prostate), delivering two HBI daily doses of 3 Gy in 2 consecutive days is as effective as delivering a daily dose of 3 Gy for 5 consecutive days. Thus, this is a faster and much more convenient HBI schedule for the palliation of pain in widespread cancer","","","","","","S036030160101495X [pii]","Department of Radiation Oncology and Cancer Center, Oakwood Healthcare System, Dearborn, MI 48123-2500, USA. salazaro@oakwood.org","PM:11395246","","","",""

Reagents are more limited and difficult to obtain as compared with other tumor types. The advanced age of the patient population presents the researcher with subjects having diminished immune systems and who are often less willing to undergo procedures for research purposes. Consequently, the majority of research has involved those cancers for which tumor and immune cells are readily available. Despite these hurdles, new and novel approaches are improving the poor overall survival rates through the development of antigen-based treatment options. These efforts are particularly important in the realm of hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC), since no therapy exists with significant clinical impact. This is a major issue for the 36,000 men who will die from the disease annually, despite transient responses to secondary treatment such as hormone ablation therapy. During the past few years, candidate target antigens for experimental vaccines have been identified in several laboratories. These include oncogenes, overexpressed proteins, and carbohydrates. Three of the furthest in clinical development are well-established clinical markers of prostate cancer: prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP). Following conclusive preclinical evidence indicating that the human body responds immunologically to prostate antigens, clinical trials have been underway for many years with PSMA, PSA, and PAP as targets. We investigated the capacity of a vaccine composed of autologous dendritic cells (DC), pulsed ex vivo with recombinant PSMA (rPS-MA), to safely generate clinically meaningful antitumor immune responses in HRPC patients. In 2000 and 2001, 32 patients with metastatic or non-metastatic HRPC were enrolled in a phase I/II clinical trial. Their peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated by leukapheresis, matured to DC by in vitro culture with maturation factors (GM-CSF, IL-4, and inactivated BCG) for up to 7 days, followed by rPSMA loading and harvesting of the vaccine. Patients received four intradermal treatments of 5, 10, or 20-million rPSMA-loaded mature DC at monthly intervals, followed by up to a total of 6 months of observation. Measurement of serum anti-PSMA antibodies, PSMA-stimulated lymphocyte proliferation, and delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) skin testing were carried out before, during, and after vaccination. Clinical responses were assessed by CT/bone scans and hematochemical laboratory tests, including PSA levels. More than 140 total vaccine injections were well tolerated; no clinical signs of autoimmunity or serious adverse events were observed. Overall, 54% of patients achieved stability of their disease at >6 months follow-up, as assessed by radiographic criteria, and 83% of patients had a PSMA-specific immune response, 92% of patients with stable disease had a PSMA-specific immune response, and 46% of patients had a decrease in PSA velocity. Compared to baseline, 93% of 27 evaluable patients converted to DTH-positive against the BCG component of the vaccine. Due to these promising initial findings we have initiated a double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III clinical trial. (c) 2002 Northwest Biotherapeutics, Inc.

The FinnProstate Study VII has been performed to identify patients who might benefit from intermittent androgen deprivation. In this interim analysis we evaluated which prognostic markers affect the initial response to androgen deprivation therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 856 men with locally advanced or metastatic prostate cancer were enrolled and given androgen deprivation therapy for 24 weeks to ensure hormone sensitivity. Patients with hormone sensitive prostate cancer were randomized 1:1 to continuous androgen deprivation or intermittent androgen deprivation. The randomization criteria were prostate specific antigen decrease to less than 10 ng/ml or by more than 50% if less than 20 ng/ml at baseline. RESULTS: There were 292 patients (34%) who did not meet the randomization criteria (group 1). The remaining 564 patients (66%) were randomized to intermittent androgen deprivation or continuous androgen deprivation (group 2). Mean prostate specific antigen (834 vs 151 ng/ml), mean alkaline phosphatase (793 vs 292 IU/l), proportion of T4 tumors (37% vs 24%), poorly differentiated cancers (39% vs 26%), metastatic disease (82% vs 51%) and number of skeletal hot spots in M1 disease (more than 5 hot spots 72% vs 42%) were significantly higher in group 1 than in group 2.

Later, the tumors in these patients become refractory to androgen-related therapies. Therefore, additional hormonal maneuvers that would benefit these men currently are needed. Reports of androgen receptor mutations and historic clinical observations raised the hypothesis that estrogens might be involved in the proliferation of androgen-refractory prostate carcinoma. METHODS: To explore this hypothesis, 14 men with advanced prostate carcinoma that was refractory to medical or surgical orchiectomy and antiandrogens were entered into a clinical Phase II trial involving suppression of estrogens. After complete evaluation, each patient received 1 mg daily of the third-generation aromatase inhibitor anastrozole until disease progression. Follow-up included serial determinations of prostate specific antigen (PSA), measurements of evaluable lesions, and assessment of intensity of pain. RESULTS: No patient experienced an objective response or disease stabilization as measured by PSA level or the greatest dimension of the lesion. Minimal improvement of bone pain was reported in two patients receiving intensive analgesic medication. CONCLUSIONS: It was concluded that the dependence of androgen-insensitive prostate carcinoma on estrogens for proliferation is uncommon and that aromatase inhibitors may not have a place in the treatment of prostate carcinoma at this stage of the disease","","","","","","10.1002/1097-0142(20011015)92:8<2095::AID-CNCR1550>3.0.CO;2-Y [pii]","Department of Medicine, University of Virginia Health System, Charlottesville, Virginia 22908, USA. rjs5y@virginia.edu","PM:11596025","","","",""

They are indicated in non-neoplastic diseases including osteoporosis, corticosteroid-induced bone loss, Paget disease, and in cancer-related diseases such as neoplastic hypercalcemia, multiple myeloma and bone metastases secondary to breast and prostate cancer. There is now extensive in vitro evidence suggesting a direct antitumor effect of bisphosphonates at different levels of action. Some new in vitro and in vivo studies support the cytostatic effects of bisphosphonates on tumor cells, and the effects on the regulation of cell growth, apoptosis, angiogenesis, cell adhesion, and invasion, with particular attention to biological properties. Well designed clinical trials are necessary to investigate whether the antitumor potential of bisphosphonates may be clinically relevant. On the basis of their effects on macrophages, we may divide bisphosphonates into two distinct categories: aminobisphosphonates, which sensitize macrophages to an inflammatory stimulus inducing an acute-phase response, and non-aminobisphosphonates that can be metabolized into macrophages and that may inhibit the inflammatory response of macrophages. There is evidence of aminobisphosphonate-induced pro-inflammatory response, in particular, related to modifications of the cytokine network. Several in vivo studies have demonstrated an acute-phase reaction after the first administration of aminobisphosphonates, with a significant increase in the main pro-inflammatory cytokines. However, a peculiar aspect concerning the action of non-aminobisphosphonates seems to be an anti-inflammatory activity caused by the inhibition of the release of inflammatory mediators from activated macrophages, such as interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and IL-1. The inhibition of inflammatory responses is demonstrated in both in vivo and in vitro models. This activity suggests the use of non-aminobisphosphonates in several inflammatory diseases characterized by macrophage-mediated production of acute-phase cytokines, as prevention of erosions in rheumatoid arthritis, and of loosening of joint prostheses, as well as possibly in osteoarthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, myelofibrosis, and hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy","","","","","","1844 [pii]","Oncology Department, University Campus Bio-Medico, Rome, Italy","PM:15244502","","","",""

These patients are exposed to a higher risk of developing skeletal-related events (SREs) with a subsequent decrease in quality of life and survival. Bisphosphonates have demonstrated to reduce and delay the appearance of SREs and to improve the quality of life also in elderly bone metastatic patients. Moreover, in vitro and in vivo preclinical studies suggest that bisphosphonates exert direct as well as indirect antitumor effect. Interestingly, recent clinical data confirm these results in bone metastatic cancer patients. However, randomized trials restricted to elderly patients with metastatic bone disease and focused to evaluate survival benefits have not yet been planned even if elderly patients, especially multiple myeloma, prostate and lung cancer patients, have been often included in trials. This review will examine in detail the preclinical rationale for using bisphosphonates as anticancer agents in elderly patients and will critically explore the first retrospective and prospective clinical evidences of an increased survival in patients treated with bisphosphonates. Moreover, we will analyze the safety of bisphosphonates in elderly population and discuss the clinical recommendations expressed by the SIOG Society for the use of bisphosphonates in elderly patients. Randomized clinical trials to assess the role of bisphosphonate therapy in the adjuvant setting are currently in progress and will be described in this review.

METHODS: Seventy-three patients with metastatic bone pain having previously undergone therapy with samarium-153-EDTMP (1 mCi/kg) were retrospectively evaluated. Routine follow-up included pain evaluation and blood counts for 2 months after treatment. Pain was evaluated using a subjective scale (from 0 to 10) before and for 8 weeks after the treatment. Blood counts were obtained before treatment and once a week for 2 months during follow-up. Dosimetry, based upon the urinary excretion of the isotope, was estimated in 41 individuals, and the resulting radiation absorbed doses were correlated with hematological data. RESULTS: Reduction in pain scores of 75% to 100% was obtained in 36 patients (49%), with a decrease of 50% to 75%, 25% to 50%, and 0% to 25% in, respectively, 20 (27%), 10 (14%), and 7 (10%) patients.

This study was designed to examine antiandrogen withdrawal effects within the context of a large multi-institutional prospective trial. METHODS: Eligibility criteria included progressive prostate adenocarcinoma despite combined androgen blockade. Eligible patients received prior initial treatment with an antiandrogen plus orchiectomy or luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist. Patients were stratified according to type of antiandrogen, type of progression (prostate-specific antigen [PSA] or radiographic), presence or absence of metastatic disease, and prior LHRH agonist versus surgical castration. RESULTS: A total of 210 eligible and evaluable patients had a median follow-up of 5.0 years; 64% of patients previously received flutamide, 32% bicalutamide, and 3% nilutamide. Of the 210 patients, 21% of patients had confirmed PSA decreases of >or=50% (95% CI, 16% to 27%). No radiographic responses were recorded. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 3 months (95% CI, 2 months to 4 months); however, 19% had 12-month or greater progression-free intervals. Median overall survival (OS) after antiandrogen withdrawal was 22 months (20 and 40 months for those with and without radiographic evidence of metastatic disease, respectively). Multivariate analyses indicated that longer duration of antiandrogen use, lower PSA at baseline, and PSA-only progression at study entry were associated with both longer PFS and OS. Longer antiandrogen use was the only significant predictor of PSA response. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate a relatively modest rate of PSA response in patients who were undergoing antiandrogen withdrawal; however, PFS can be relatively prolonged (>or=1 year) in approximately 19% of patients","","","","","","10.1002/cncr.23473 [doi]","Lank Center for Genitourinary Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, USA. osarto@yahoo.com","PM:18383517","","","",""

After careful assessment of symptoms and localization of pain, a bone scan is the single most useful imaging modality for the clinician to assess patients for the presence and distribution of osteoblastic lesions. Increased uptake (compatible with bony metastases) on a conventional bone scan is currently a prerequisite for treating patients with a bone-targeted therapeutic isotope. Determining whether metastatic bony involvement is focal or diffuse is also important in the clinical decision-making process. Patients with multifocal metastatic disease are excellent candidates for systemic therapies, whereas patients with unifocal metastatic disease may be more appropriate candidates for focal therapies such as external-beam radiation. Patients who are poorly tolerant of narcotics should be actively considered for alternative treatments such as systemic radiopharmaceuticals. Contraindications to administration of current bone-seeking radioisotopes include substantial degrees of renal insufficiency or bone marrow suppression","","","","","","","Department of Hematology/Oncology, Louisiana State University School of Medicine, Room 459, 533 Bolivar, New Orleans, LA 70112, USA. osarto@lsuhsc.edu","PM:12667425","","","",""

METHODS: A total of 152 men with hormone-refractory prostate cancer and painful bone metastases were enrolled in a prospective, randomized, double-blind trial comparing radioactive (153Sm) versus nonradioactive (152Sm) lexidronam complexes. Patients were randomized (2:1) to the radioactive (153Sm) agent. Patient diaries recording daily pain and analgesic use were completed during a planned 16-week evaluation period. Nonresponders were informed of the treatment received after 4 weeks of treatment and, if initially treated with placebo, were allowed to receive 153Sm-lexidronam in an open-label fashion. Pain was measured using validated patient-derived visual analog scales and pain descriptor scales. RESULTS: 153Sm-lexidronam had positive effects on measures of pain relief compared with placebo within 1 to 2 weeks. Reductions in opioid use were recorded at weeks 3 and 4. Because nonresponders were unblinded at week 4, statistical comparisons between the arms beyond week 4 were not possible. Mild, transient bone marrow suppression was the only adverse event associated with 153Sm-lexidronam administration. The mean nadir white blood cell and platelet count (3 to 4 weeks after treatment) was 3800/microL and 127,000/microL, respectively. Counts recovered to baseline after approximately 8 weeks. No grade 4 decreases in either platelets or white bloods cells were documented.

The purpose of the analysis was to assess the safety and efficacy of repeated doses of Sm-153 in patients with metastatic bone pain. METHODS: Data were collected prospectively for 202 patients administered 1.0 mCi/kg of Sm-153. Particular emphasis was placed on analysis of data from 55 patients receiving > or = 2 doses. Pain scores, adverse events, and hematologic parameters were assessed after each dose. RESULTS: Mild, transient suppression of platelets and white blood cell counts was the most common adverse event after treatment. Nadirs were approximately half of baseline at 4 weeks after dosing with recovery by Week 8 in 90% of patients. Temporary grade 3 thrombocytopenia occurred in 11%, 12%, and 17% of patients after the first, second, and third drug administration, respectively. Grade 3 leukopenia occurred in less than 7% of patients independent of the number of administrations. Significant decreases in pain scores (P < .001) were observed at Week 4 after each of the first 3 doses and maintained at Week 8 after the first 2 doses (P < .003) but not the third. Decreases in pain scores were observed in 70%, 63%, and 80% of patients, respectively, at Week 4 after the first 3 administrations. CONCLUSIONS: Repeated dosing of 1.0 mCi/kg of Sm-153 was both safe and effective and is a reasonable treatment option in patients whose bone pain responds and then recurs after an initial dose provided that adequate hematologic function is present at the time of drug administration","","","","","","10.1002/cncr.22431 [doi]","Lank Center for Genitourinary Oncology, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA. oliver_sartor@dfci.harvard.edu","PM:17167764","","","",""

Though curative strategies have long been present for men with localized disease, metastatic prostate cancer is currently incurable. Though substantial improvements in outcomes are now possible through the utilization of newly approved therapies, novel combinations are clearly needed. Herein we describe potentially synergistic interactions between bone stromal-targeted radiopharmaceuticals and other therapies for treatment of bone-metastatic prostate cancer. Radiation has long been known to syn ergize with cytotoxic chemotherapies and recent data also suggest the possibility of synergy when combining radiation and immune-based strategies. Combination therapies will be required to substantially improve survival for men with castrate-resistant metastatic prostate cancer and we hypothesize that bone-targeted radiopharmaceuticals will play an important role in this process.

Osteoblasts and osteoclasts are both pathologically activated in the setting of prostate cancer bone metastases. As osteoclast activation is associated with disease progression, skeletal complications and death, osteoclast-targeted therapies are a rational approach to disease management. Zoledronic acid is standard of care for castration-resistant prostate cancer with bone metastases as it reduces the risk for skeletal-related events. Additional trials are needed to better define the ideal dose, frequency and duration of zoledronic acid therapy. No bisphosphonate has yet been shown to prevent bone metastases or to benefit men with androgen-sensitive disease. Denosumab is an experimental osteoclast-targeted monoclonal antibody against receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand. Two ongoing phase III trials are expected to define its efficacy in preventing bone metastases and disease-related skeletal events in men with prostate cancer. Androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) for prostate cancer is associated with osteoporosis and fragility fractures. Several bisphosphonates have been shown to improve bone mineral density in men receiving ADT. Two recent phase III trials have shown that denosumab and toremifene reduce the incidence of fragility fractures in these men. The World Health Organization has developed a fracture risk assessment model (FRAX) for the general population to guide the selection of patients who may benefit from pharmacotherapy.

Because most men diagnosed with prostate cancer will die of something other than their cancer, treatment-related adverse effects are highly relevant to their long-term health. Benefits of ADT in each clinical setting must be weighed against ADT-related adverse effects. ADT is detrimental to several metabolic end points and to bone health. ADT has been prospectively shown to cause decreased lean muscle mass, increased fat mass, weight gain, increased cholesterol and triglycerides, insulin resistance, and loss of bone mineral density. In population-based analyses it has been associated with an increased incidence of diabetes, clinical fractures, and cardiovascular disease. Data-driven recommendations for managing these adverse effects are needed. Currently the authors advocate the use of adapted practice guidelines developed to prevent diabetes, fractures, and coronary heart disease in the general population.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We retrospectively studied patients treated in three trials evaluating a taxane or an epothilone for progressive castration-resistant prostate cancer. Study subjects were 98 patients with bone metastases; 63 of them also had soft tissue lesions. All scans were reviewed independently. Associations of radiographic progression-free survival and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression-free survival with survival time were measured using Kendall's tau, adjusted for right censoring. A smoothing procedure was applied to estimate Kendall's tau within each neighborhood of the follow-up process. RESULTS: The overall associations between progression-free survival time and overall survival time were moderate: 0.4 for radiographic progression-free survival and 0.33 for PSA progression-free survival. The association between radiographic progression-free survival and overall survival was weakest early in the follow-up process, whereas the PSA association was weakest when the progression-free survival-related event (PSA progression, death, or censoring) occurred after 6 months from the start of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Current measures of progression-free survival time for men with castration-resistant prostate cancer are not strongly concordant with survival time. Factors that attenuate the association include interval censoring and the discontinuation of therapy early in the follow-up due to imaging changes that may not reflect true failure of the treatment. For radiographic progression-free survival, the association may be increased by requiring confirmation of progression with a second scan, as is routinely done when assessing response","","","","","","13/5/1488 [pii];10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-06-1885 [doi]","Genitourinary Oncology Service, Department of Medicine, Sidney Kimmel Center for Prostate and Urologic Cancers, Weill Medical College of Cornell University, New York, New York, USA. scherh@mskcc.org","PM:17332293","","","",""

This makes objective evaluation of chemotherapeutic agents difficult. Prostate specific antigen (PSA) as a dynamic model was analyzed as potential auxiliary end point in HRPCa. METHODS: In the framework of a master protocol, the Swiss Group for Clinical Cancer Research (SAKK) is evaluating cytotoxic drugs in HRPCa since 1991. These prospective phase II trials include uniform requirements with regard to response, toxicity and quality of life. From the entire pool of patients, 40 with bidimensionally measurable metastases (lymph nodes, visceral organs) could be identified. PSA doubling time was calculated in patients with a rising PSA during therapy. RESULTS: Objective best response to any given chemotherapeutic agent was: partial remission (PR) in six patients (15%), stable disease (SD) in 13 (32%) and progressive disease (PD) in 21 (53%). PSA remained stable or decreased in four of six patients with PR (67%), seven of 13 with SD (54%) but only in four of 21 with PD (19%) (Cochran-Armitage test for trend; p=0.015). The median PSA doubling time for patients with a rising PSA was 238 days in PR and 224 days in SD, compared to 113 days in PD (Wilcoxon test; p=0.002). CONCLUSIONS: PSA doubling time is a potential auxiliary end point in the evaluation of cytotoxic drugs in HRPCa.

Materials and methods: Published literature on the natural history of nonmetastatic AIPC was reviewed. Phase III clinical trials using docetaxel-based therapy were analyzed as well as their associated quality of life (QOL) findings. Trials using docetaxel in earlier stage of the disease, as well those using novel agents were examined. Results: Based on one report, non-metastatic AIPC is relatively indolent, and there is currently no evidence that supports the use of chemotherapy in this disease subset. The results of TAX 327 and SWOG 9916 demonstrate that chemotherapy is indicated for metastatic AIPC. However, based on available data, more than one hormonal maneuver can be offered to patients before chemotherapy is initiated. Timing of docetaxel therapy can further be individualized based on risk, clinical status, and patients' values and preferences. Building on the success of docetaxel, several novel agents that target different pathways are being tested in combination with, or as an alternative to, docetaxel-based therapy in Phase III clinical trials. Conclusions: Currently, docetaxel therapy should be reserved for patients with metastatic AIPC who have progressed despite one or more hormonal therapies. In most patients, more than one hormonal treatment can be offered before chemotherapy is initiated. Studies that test the efficacy of chemotherapy early in the natural history of prostate cancer are under way or are planned. (c) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

For prostate cancer, common clinical scenarios include managing the patient presenting with 1) low-risk primary cancer; 2) high-risk primary cancer; 3) prostate-specific antigen (PSA) recurrence after apparently successful primary therapy; 4) progressive metastatic disease in the noncastrate state; and 5) progressive metastatic disease in the castrate state. These clinical states dictate the appropriate choice of diagnostic imaging modalities. The role of positron emission tomography (PET) is still evolving but is likely to be most important in determining early spread of disease in patients with aggressive tumors and for monitoring response to therapy in more advanced patients. Available PET tracers for assessment of prostate cancer include FDG, 11C or 18F choline and acetate, 11C methionine, 18F fluoride, and fluorodihydrotestosterone. Proper staging of prostate cancer is particularly important in high-risk primary disease before embarking on radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy. PET with 11C choline or acetate, but not with FDG, appears promising for the assessment of nodal metastases. PSA relapse frequently is the first sign of recurrent or metastatic disease after radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy. PET with FDG can identify local recurrence and distant metastases, and the probability for a positive test increases with PSA. However, essentially all studies have shown that the sensitivity for recurrent disease detection is higher with either acetate or choline as compared with FDG. Although more data need to be gathered, it is likely that these two agents will become the PET tracers of choice for staging prostate cancer once metastatic disease is strongly suspected or documented. 18F fluoride may provide a more sensitive bone scan and will probably be most valuable when PSA is greater than 20 ng/mL in patients with high suspicion or documented osseous metastases. Several studies suggest that FDG uptake in metastatic prostate cancer lesions reflects the biologic activity of the disease. Accordingly, FDG can be used to monitor the response to chemotherapy and hormonal therapy. Androgen receptor imaging agents like fluorodihydrotestosterone are being explored to predict the biology of treatment response for progressive tumor in late stage disease in castrated patients. The assessment of renal masses and primary staging of renal cell carcinoma are the domain of helical CT. PET with FDG may be helpful in the evaluation of 'equivocal findings' on conventional studies, including bone scan, and also in the differentiation between recurrence and posttreatment changes. The value of other PET tracers in renal cell carcinoma is under investigation. Few studies have addressed the role of PET in bladder cancer. Because of its renal excretion, FDG is not a useful tracer for the detection of primary bladder tumors. The few studies that investigated its role in the detection of lymph node metastases at the time of primary staging were largely disappointing. Bladder cancer imaging with 11C choline, 11C methionine, or 11C- acetate deserves further study","","","","","","S000129980400042X [pii]","Department of Radiology/Nuclear Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021, USA","PM:15493005","","","",""

Comparison was made with magnetic resonance imaging (n = 64), bone scan (n = 56), and computed tomography (n = 37). The standard of reference included biopsy or clinical and imaging follow-up. We calculated sensitivity and specificity of PET and correlated PET findings with PSA values, other clinical parameters, and conventional imaging, when available. RESULTS: PET was true positive in 28 of 91 (31%) patients, showing isolated disease in the prostate bed (n = 3) or metastatic disease with (n = 2) or without (n = 23) simultaneous disease in the prostate bed. In detail, PET identified lesions in the prostate bed (n = 5, all true positives), bones (n = 22; 20 true positives, 2 false positives), lymph nodes (n = 7; 6 true positives, 1 likely false positive), and one liver metastasis. Mean PSA was higher in PET-positive than in PET-negative patients (9.5 +/- 2.2 versus 2.1 +/- 3.3 ng/mL). PSA of 2.4 ng/mL and PSA velocity of 1.3 ng/mL/y provided the best tradeoff between sensitivity (80%; 71%) and specificity (73%; 77%) of PET in a receiver operating curve analysis. Combination with other clinical parameters in a multivariate analysis did not improve disease prediction.

Median response times with HDK tend to be brief but a significant minority of AIPC patients benefit with extended responses. Well characterized response and survival information, especially in the cohort of patients who experience these longer, more durable, responses has not been previously reported. Characterization of this subgroup is of particular interest since men with long-term responses derive the greatest benefit from HDK therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The medical records of 78 patients with AIPC treated with HDK between March 1991 and February 1999 were retrospectively reviewed. Baseline clinical and laboratory factors predictive of prolonged response and survival were identified. RESULTS: The median baseline prostate specific antigen (PSA) before the initiation of HDK was 25.1. The number of patients with zero, 1 to 3, and more than 3 lesions on bone scan were 25, 35 and 18, respectively. Median and mean time to PSA progression was 6.7 and 14.5 months. Median and mean survival time was 38.0 and 42.4 months, respectively. Response time and survival were highly correlated (r = 0.799). A total of 34 (44%) men had a greater than 75% decrease in PSA. The median survival times in men with more vs less than a 75% decrease were 60 vs 24 months, respectively. In a Cox proportional hazard regression, prolonged survival was predicted by percent PSA decrease, extent of disease on bone scan and baseline PSA. CONCLUSIONS: Ketoconazole can induce prolonged responses, occasionally lasting for years. Long responses are more likely to occur in men initiating HDK earlier in the course of disease before the cancer burden becomes excessive","","","","","","S0022-5347(05)60184-X [pii];10.1097/01.ju.0000158449.83022.40 [doi]","Prostate Oncology Specialists, Marina del Rey, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California, USA. mark@prostateoncology.com","PM:15879788","","","",""

The issue is addressed in European Organisation for the Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) protocol 30846 for patients with lymph node-positive (pN1-3) cancer without local treatment of the primary tumour. Objective: To evaluate the effect of early versus delayed treatment in pN1-3 PCa. Design, setting, and participants: Two hundred thirty-four patients with histologically proven PCa and nodal metastases (pN1-3) were randomized to immediate versus delayed ET without treatment of the primary tumour. ET consisted of a depot luteinising hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist and 1 mo of an anti-androgen or surgical castration. The trial's main objective was to show non-inferiority of delayed ET to immediate ET by ruling out a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.50 for overall survival (OS), with 85% power at one-sided alpha = 5%. Measurements: All but three patients were treated as randomized. The median follow-up is 13 yr. The median protocol treatment duration was 2.7 yr in the delayed and 3.2 yr in the immediate ET groups. Results and limitations: Overall, 193 patients (82.5%) have died (97 on delayed ET and 96 on immediate ET), 59.4% of them as a result of PCa. The intention-to-treat analysis shows a 22% increase in the hazard of death of those randomized to delayed treatment (HR = 1.22, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.92, 1.62). The difference is not statistically significant, but non-inferiority is also not proved. The median OS on immediate ET is 7.6 yr (95% CI, 6.3-8.3 yr) versus 6.1 yr (95% CI, 5.7-7.3 yr) in the delayed ET group. The 10-yr cumulative incidence of death resulting from PCa was 55.6% in the delayed ET group versus 52.1% with immediate ET group. Similar conclusions hold for PCa-specific survival. Conclusions: After 13 years of follow-up, survival or PCa-specific survival between immediate and delayed ET appear similar, but the trial is underpowered to reach its goal of showing non-inferiority.

PATIENTS AND METHODS In the randomized, phase III trial (CS21), patients with histologically confirmed prostate cancer (all stages), were randomized to one of three regimens: degarelix subcutaneous 240 mg for 1 month followed by monthly maintenance doses of 80 mg or 160 mg, or intramuscular leuprolide 7.5 mg/month. Patients receiving leuprolide could also receive antiandrogens for flare protection. We report exploratory S-ALP analyses from CS21, focusing on the comparison of degarelix 240/80 mg with leuprolide 7.5 mg, in line with the recent approvals of this dose by the USA Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency. RESULTS Overall, 610 patients were included, with a median age of 73 years and median prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level of 19.0 ng/mL. Baseline S-ALP levels were high in metastatic patients and highest in patients with metastatic disease and a haemoglobin level of <13 g/dL. In metastatic disease, after initial peaks in both groups, S-ALP levels were suppressed below baseline with degarelix but were maintained around baseline with leuprolide. The late rise in S-ALP seen with leuprolide was not apparent with degarelix. The pattern of S-ALP response was similar in patients with a baseline PSA level of > or =50 ng/mL. Between-treatment differences in patients with metastatic disease and those with a PSA level of > or =50 ng/mL were significant at day 364 (P = 0.014 and 0.007, respectively). CONCLUSION Patients with metastatic disease or those with PSA levels of > or =50 ng/mL at baseline had greater reductions in S-ALP levels with degarelix than with leuprolide. Patients in the degarelix group maintained S-ALP suppression throughout the study, in contrast to those in the leuprolide group. This suggests that degarelix might offer better S-ALP control than leuprolide and might prolong control of skeletal metastases, compared with GnRH agonists, over a 1-year treatment period","","","","","","BJU8981 [pii];10.1111/j.1464-410X.2009.08981.x [doi]","Department of Urology, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, the Netherlands. f.schroder@erasmusmc.nl","PM:19912212","","","",""

Atrasentan is a potent, selective, endothelin-A (ET SUB A) receptor antagonist that has been shown to block the mitogenic, anti-apoptotic, and bone-remodelling activity of endothelin-1 (ET-1) in pre-clinical studies. Orally bioavailable, with a half-life suitable for once-daily dosing, atrasentan will provide optimal convenience for patients requiring long-term therapy. Phase I d ose-escalation studies have shown the drug to be well tolerated at a clinical dose of 10 mg in patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC). This favourable tolerability profile has been confirmed in phase II studies, in which headache, rhinitis, asthenia and peripheral oedema have been identified as the most common adverse events. Recently, a large, multi-centre, phase II study has indicated that atrasentan delayed disease progression and time to prostate serum antigen (PSA) progression in metastatic HRPC, and was associated with improvements in quality of life compared with placebo. Furthermore, evidence has emerged from this and other studies that atrasentan may attenuate tumour-induced bone remodelling, impeding the progression of skeletal disease in patients with HRPC. Atrasentan is currently being investigated in two phase III clinical studies, one in patients with advanced metastatic HRPC, the other in patients with non-metastatic HRPC who are failing hormonal ablation therapy. The results are awaited with interest. (c) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved","","","","","","","","","","","",""

RECENT FINDINGS: Despite the existing data supporting the use of androgen deprivation therapy in prostate cancer patients, several questions regarding timing, survival benefit and impact in quality of life remain quite controversial. Although androgen deprivation therapy appears to increase overall survival in select populations with locally advanced and symptomatic metastatic prostate cancer, their side-effects often lead to secondary short and long-term toxicities that negatively impact patient's quality of life and ultimately affect their survival. In addition to the most common side-effects of low testosterone levels such as hot flushes, lack of libido, erectile dysfunction, gynecomastia and bone mineral density loss, recent studies have confirmed the detrimental effects of low testosterone states on patient's cardiac risk profile and development of metabolic syndrome ultimately leading to an increase risk of diabetes, hyperlipidemia and heart disease. SUMMARY: Long-term use of androgen deprivation in prostate cancer patients continues to increase. Timing of therapy should be optimized based on each individual's prostate cancer natural history and medical risk profile. Emphasis should be placed on quality of life concerns, with adequate pretreatment education of anticipated side-effects, individualization of therapy, and review of strategies for prevention of side-effects.

These metastases are predominantly blastic (bone-forming) and commonly cause increased serum levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH) as calcium ions are transferred from serum into blastic bone. The epidemiologic and clinical significance of secondary hyperparathyroidism in advanced prostate cancer have not been widely appreciated. Prostate cancer bony metastases show increased expression of the PTH receptor (PTH-IR) and PTH promotes the growth and invasiveness of prostate cancer cells in bone. Thus, blastic metastases appear to induce a 'vicious cycle' in which PTH resorbs normal bone to support the growth of blastic bone. Recognition of the potential role of PTH in the progression of skeletal metastases suggests novel opportunities for prostate cancer secondary prevention. In particular, we propose that suppressing serum PTH in advanced prostate cancer may reduce morbidity by decreasing fractures and pain caused by bone resorption and may reduce mortality by retarding the progression of metastatic disease.

This has provided an ideal target for therapeutic interventions in metabolic bone disease. As described in previous reviews in this supplement, RANKL signaling is required for osteoclast differentiation, activation, and survival. Furthermore, in vivo inhibition of RANKL leads to immediate osteoclast apoptosis, and there are no in vivo models of bone resorption that are refractory to RANKL inhibition. Thus, the only step remaining in the development of a clinical intervention is the generation of a safe, effective, and specific drug that can inhibit RANKL in humans. Here we review the clinical development of denosumab (formerly known as AMG 162), which is a fully human mAb directed against RANKL.

METHODS: Sixty patients with painful bone metastases from different tumor types were treated with 1406 MBq 186Re-HEDP. After treatment, the patients were followed up clinically at weekly intervals for the first month and monthly thereafter up to 1 y, until death or pain relapse. Pain response was graded as complete, partial, minimal, or absent using the Wisconsin test scoring system. Duration of pain relief, performance status, tumor markers, serum alkaline phosphatase levels, hematologic toxicity, and metastatic bone progression were also evaluated. RESULTS: Overall, 80% of individuals experienced prompt relief of pain, with 31% complete, 34% partial, and 15% minimal responses. Transient World Health Organization grade 1-2 hematologic toxicity was apparent, with a decrease in the mean platelet (32%) and mean leukocyte (18%) counts at 3 and 4 wk, respectively.

Although many of these men have an excellent outcome, a significant proportion subsequently experience disease recurrence or cancer-related death. Men with unfavorable tumor characteristics at the time of radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy are particularly at high risk of experiencing disease recurrence. One strategy to improve outcome for these men is adjuvant hormone therapy (hormone therapy administered immediately after therapy of primary curative intent). Surgical castration (bilateral orchiectomy), medical castration using the luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist goserelin, and antiandrogen monotherapy have been investigated as adjuvant hormone therapy to radical prostatectomy and radiotherapy, and each therapy has demonstrated clinical benefits because of a significant improvement in disease-free survival. Furthermore, data are available to indicate that adjuvant hormone therapy achieved by goserelin or bilateral orchiectomy improves overall survival, particularly in men at high risk of progression. Because the effects of LHRH agonists are reversible, they provide a more acceptable method of adjuvant therapy compared to bilateral orchiectomy, particularly in the adjuvant setting, and are preferred by patients. However, the adverse effects on quality of life, in particular on sexual interest and function and bone mineral density, may limit the use of LHRH agonists in some patients. However, these parameters are maintained with nonsteroidal antiandrogens. The first data from the Early Prostate Cancer program indicate that adjuvant bicalutamide 150 mg is associated with a significant improvement in progression-free survival after radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy. Gynecomastia and breast pain are the most common side effects associated with bicalutamide therapy. Medical or surgical castration in combination with an antiandrogen (combined androgen blockade) is another option for use as an adjuvant hormone therapy. However, no study has reported on the use of combined androgen blockade in this setting. Adjuvant hormone therapy provides clinicians with another treatment option for patients with early prostate cancer and unfavorable tumor characteristics","","","","","","","Division of Urology, Medical College of Wisconsin, Froedtert Memorial Lutheran Hospital, 9200 West Wisconsin Avenue, Milwaukee, WI 53226, USA. wsee@mcw.edu","PM:12941195","","","",""

Thus, often palliative therapeutic measures are required with respect of a life span beyond one year, especially if no lyphogenic or visceral metastases have developed. Similarly to patients with breast carcinoma the metastatic bone lesions in prostate carcinoma patients have mixed osteolytic and osteoblastic features with increased metabolic bone turn-over. This is the mechanism, in which bisphosphonates interfere and can prevent the pathologic bone resorption by blocking osteoclast activity. This improves not only painful clinical conditions but also reduces the rate of skeletal related events (SRE = hypercalcemia, bone fracture, myelon compression, surgery or radiotherapy to bone etc.). Generally, clinical studies suggest the benefit of bisphosphonates for patients with bone metastases and good life expectancy. For patients with prostate carcinoma large controlled studies have to consolidate this potential benefit","","","","","","","Klinik fur Radioonkologie, Strahlentherapie & Nuklearmedizin, Alfried Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach Krankenhaus, Essen, Deutschland","PM:11675918","","","",""

Patients and Methods: From January 1996 to January 2004, 203 patients with advanced CAP were treated by androgen ablation. Patients presenting with retention were catheterized initially, and those (N = 12) who failed a catheter-free trial and had immediate channel TURP were excluded. The remaining 191 patients were followed every 3 months (mean 35.5 months, range 6-92 months). Pa tients requiring channel TURP (group 1; N = 42 [22%]) during follow-up were compared with those who did not (group 2) for predictive factors, viz. retention of urine, serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) concentration, Gleason sum, prostate size, and bony metastasis at presentation. Results: Channel TURP was performed at a mean of 21 months (range 3-72 months). The mean Gleason sum in this group was 7.88, whereas it was 7.29 in group 2 (P = 0.013). Retention at presentation was significantly more common in group 1 (N = 26; 61.9%) than in group 2 (N = 46; 30.8%; P = 0.001). Patients who did not present with retention and had Gleason sums <=7 (N = 32) did not require channel TURP. Of the 14 patients who voided successfully after a catheter-free trial but had Gleason sums of >7, 71.4% required channel TURP. Other factors were not found to be significantly different in the two groups. Conclusion: High Gleason sum and retention at presentation are significant factors predictors of the need for channel TURP during follow-up in patients with advanced CAP receiving androgen ablation therapy.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-five patients received docetaxel-based chemotherapy; data were collected retrospectively from three different departments. Progression was known in 44 (79%) and the PSA-DT was available in 33 patients. RESULTS: Of the 29 patients with soft-tissue and soft-tissue plus bone metastases, 22 (76%) developed soft-tissue progression. Among the 35 patients with bone and bone plus soft-tissue metastases, 27 (77%) had osseous progression. There was no difference between the PSA-DT at progression before and after docetaxel-based therapy (mean 3.1 vs 2.7 months, P = 0.592, Student's t-test.). However, the median (range) PSA-DT at progression after docetaxel-based therapy was 0.84 (0.3-4) months in patients with a PSA response, significantly shorter than the median of 3.1 (0.3-12) months of patients with no biochemical response (P = 0.002, Student's t-test). The PSA-DT dynamics at progression had no effect on survival (P = 0.63, log-rank test). CONCLUSION: The pattern of progression after docetaxel-based chemotherapy is predominantly osseous in patient with bone metastases and mostly soft-tissue in those with soft-tissue disease. Progression after docetaxel-based chemotherapy in AIPC does not modify the PSA-DT before docetaxel. Evaluation of a larger population is needed to assess the clinical relevance of PSA dynamics after docetaxel therapy","","","","","","BJU7037 [pii];10.1111/j.1464-410X.2007.07037.x [doi]","Department of Oncology, Assaf Harofeh Medical Center, Zerifin (affiliated to Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Ramat Aviv), Israel. avisella@netvision.net.il","PM:17559560","","","",""

METHODS: Various studies have been performed utilizing a short-lived radioisotope conjugated to a tetraphosphonate (samarium 153 lexidronam) both as an open label and as a double blinded, placebo-controlled study. Patients with varying tumor types including those of the prostate, breast, lung, and other sites were studied. Two dose levels were used (0.5 millicuries (mCi)/kg and 1.0 mCi/kg) with patients monitored for 16 weeks for efficacy (pain scores, opiod analgesic score, and quality of life) parameters and adverse events. RESULTS: All 3 studies showed that at the 1.0 mCi/kg dose level statistically significant improvement over placebo was observed by 4 weeks with relief of pain noted in many patients by 1 week. The only significant adverse event was transient myelosuppression with a nadir at 4-6 weeks and recovery by 8 weeks. Less than 10% of patients had National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria Grade III/IV bone marrow toxicity recorded. CONCLUSIONS: Systemic metabolic radiotherapy with samarium 153 lexidronam appears to be a safe and efficacious method for treating patients with bone pain. The shorter radioisotope half-life allows for a high dose rate to be delivered over a short period, which may have certain biologic benefits","","","","","","10.1002/1097-0142(20000615)88:12+<2934::AID-CNCR9>3.0.CO;2-S [pii]","Department of Radiology and Medicine, University of Miami School of Medicine, Florida 33136, USA","PM:10898337","","","",""

The objective of this review is to determine the incidence of bone loss and osteoporosis in patients with PCa who are or are not treated with hormone therapy (ADT). METHODS: The Medline, Embase, Cancerlit, and American Society of Clinical Oncology Abstract databases were searched for published studies on prostate cancer and bone metabolism. The outcomes assessed were: fracture, osteoporosis and osteopenia. RESULTS: Thirty-two articles (116,911 participants) were included in the meta-analysis. PCa patients under ADT had a higher risk of osteoporosis (RR, 1.30; p < 0.00001) and a higher risk of fractures (RR, 1.17; p < 0.00001) as compared to patients not under ADT. The total bone mineral density was lower in patients under ADT when compared with patients not under ADT (p = 0.031) but it was similar to bone mineral density found in healthy controls (p = 0.895). The time of androgen deprivation therapy correlated negatively with lumbar spine and total hip bone mineral density (Spearman's rho = -0.490 and -0.773; p = 0.028 and 0.001, respectively) and with total hip t score (Spearman's rho = -0.900; p = 0.037).

PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 1983 to 1990, 41 patients with advanced prostate carcinoma were treated with flutamide monotherapy until progression or the appearance of toxicity. Twenty-five patients (61%) had T3-T4N0M0 and 16 (39%) T2-4N0-3M1 prostate carcinoma. Consensus criteria were adopted to evaluate the response. Plasma testosterone and sexual function were recorded for the first 3 years. RESULTS: Flutamide was administered for up to 147 months; seven patients (17%) interrupted the treatment because of toxicity. There was an objective response in 17 (41%) patients; 20 (49%) had stable disease while four (10%) progressed. There were objective responses, lasting up to 150 months, in 82% of those with M0 and in 18% with M1 disease (P = 0.05). The median time to progression in patients with an objective response and stable disease was 45 and 16 months, respectively (P < 0.001). Thirty-one patients (76%) died from prostate cancer and 10 (24%) from unrelated diseases. The median survival was 67 and 36 months in patients with an objective response and stable disease, respectively (P < 0.001). There was an improvement in performance status in 85% and reduction in bone pain in 83% of the patients; sexual activity was maintained in 63%.

men are still dying of this disease. Management of advanced disease focuses on controlling the disease process, palliation of symptoms and improving quality of life. In this review, the basis for androgen deprivation in hormone-dependent disease is discussed and the role of maximum and intermittent androgen deprivation, as well as management options for hormone-refractory disease is addressed. Local radiotherapy continues to be of importance in pain control and the maintenance of quality of life. Radiopharmaceuticals and bis phosphonates also have a role to play, the latter particularly in the reduction of skeletal-related events. Chemotherapy in hormone-refractory disease is now well established following pivotal trials demonstrating a survival benefit with docetaxel. The emergence of novel agents targeting growth factors, angiogenesis and immunotherapy present exciting possibilities for future treatment.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 28 men with asymptomatic castration recurrent prostate cancer were treated with 3.5 mg dutasteride daily (luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone treatment continued), and evaluated monthly for response and toxicity. Eligibility included appropriate duration antiandrogen withdrawal, baseline prostate specific antigen 2.0 ng/ml or greater and a new lesion on bone scan, increase in measurable disease using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria, or 2 or more consecutive prostate specific antigen measurements increased over baseline. Outcomes were progression, stable disease, partial response (prostate specific antigen less than 50% of enrollment for 4 or more weeks) or complete response. RESULTS: There were 25 evaluable men with a mean age of 70 years (range 57 to 88), a mean prostate specific antigen of 61.9 ng/ml (range 5.0 to 488.9) and mean Gleason score 8 (range 6 to 10), 15 of whom had bone metastases. Eight men had 10 grade 3 or higher adverse events using National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria, all of which were judged to be unrelated to treatment. Of the 25 men 14 had disease progression by 2 months, 9 had stable (2.5, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 8.5, 9 months) disease, 2 had a partial response and none had a complete response. Overall median time to progression was 1.87 months (range 1 to 10, 95% CI 1.15-3.91). CONCLUSIONS: Dutasteride rarely produces biochemical responses in men with castration recurrent prostate cancer.

METHODS: From 2001 to 2008, 270 men with chemotherapy-naive CRPC were randomly assigned, in a 1 : 1 ratio, to receive either DAiS or DAdS. They were stratified for performance status, presence of bone metastases, and previous normalisation of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) to androgen deprivation. The study end points were the proportion of patients achieving a 50% PSA response, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival, and quality of life. Intention-to-treat analysis was carried out. The effect of treatment was studied first by Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank test, and finally through multivariable stratified Cox's proportional hazards model adjusting for the effects of possible baseline prognostic factors. Quality of life was analysed using multivariate analysis of variance. RESULTS: At study entry, the median age was 76 years (inter-quartile range: 70-80 years), the median PSA was 79 ng ml(-1), and 76% of the cohort had metastatic disease. The response rates for DAiS (68%) and DAdS (64%) were not significantly different (P=0.49). Similar to the response rate, neither the PFS (median=8.1 months for both arms) nor the overall survival (19.4 vs 18.8 months) differed significantly between the DAiS and DAdS groups (P>0.20). However, the response rate for the DAiS (68%) was significantly higher than the response rate of DA (before adding Diethylstilbestrol) (50%) (P=0.002). Similarly, the median time to progression for DAiS (8.6 months) was significantly longer than that of DA (4.5 months) (P<0.001). Multivariable analysis showed that patients with previous haemoglobin >/=11 g dl(-1) decreased the risk of death significantly (hazard ratio: 0.44, 95% CI: 0.25-0.77). Patients treated with previous anti-androgens alone had more than 5 times more risk of death compared with patients treated with gonadorelin analogues throughout their castration-sensitive phase. Treatment sequencing did not affect the quality of life but pre-treatment performance status did. The incidence of veno-thromboembolic events was 22% (n=28) in DAiS and 11% (n=14) in the DA arm (P=0.02). Painful gynaecomastia occurred in only 1% on DA, whereas in 40% on DAiS (P=0.001). CONCLUSION: Dexamethasone and immediate Diethylstilbestrol resulted in neither higher PSA response rate nor higher PFS compared with Dexamethasone with deferred Diethylstilbestrol. There was no suggestion of significantly improved overall survival or quality of life. Given the significantly higher toxicity of Diethylstilbestrol, deferring Diethylstilbestrol until failure of Dexamethasone is the preferred strategy when using these agents in CRPC","","","","","","bjc20117 [pii];10.1038/bjc.2011.7 [doi]","St Bartholomew's Hospital, 7th Floor, Gloucester House, Little Britain, UK. jonathan.shamash@bartsandthelondon.nhs.uk","PM:21285990","","","",""

The 131I-labeled form of TAM (131I-TAM) was developed to study the tumor response to antiestrogenic treatment and the ER expression in tumors and critical normal tissues (3). TAM as first approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration in the 1970s for use in breast cancer treatment. Currently, it is widely used for the treatment of both early and advanced ER-positive breast cancer, as well as for the prevention of breast cancer in high-risk women (1, 4, 5). TAM itself is a prodrug, having relatively little affinity to ER. It is metabolized in the liver, mainly by the CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes (5, 6). Active metabolites such as 4-hydroxytamoxifen and N-desmethyl-4-hydroxytamoxifen have 30-100 times more affinity with the ER than TAM itself. These metabolites compete with estrogen for binding to ER and form a nuclear complex that inhibits DNA synthesis and blocks estrogen effects (5, 6). As a result, tumor cells stop proliferating and remain in the G0 and G1 phases of the cell cycle. In combination with other therapeutic agents or alone, TAM has also been shown to be antiangiogenic, which is, at least in part, independent of its ER-antagonist properties (7). TAM also has a number of other beneficial properties. For example, TAM lowers low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, increases bone density in postmenopausal women, and is effective against infertility in women with anovulatory disorders. In men, TAM is used to treat breast cancer, and it is also used to treat gynecomastia that arises from anti-androgen treatment in patients with prostate cancer. TAM has some side effects. It blocks the estrogen effects on mammary epithelial cells, but it mimics the estrogen actions in other tissues (2). The result of such selective effects on the uterus is stimulated proliferation of the endometrium (8). Each year, the risk of developing endometrial cancer is ~2 per thousand in women taking TAM compared with ~1 per thousand in women taking placebo (9). TAM also slightly increases the risk of developing uterine sarcoma. The other side effects include blood clots, strokes, cataracts, and symptoms of menopause. To maintain the beneficial properties without sharing the potentially harmful effects of TAM, a number of derivatives have been developed (2). However, these derivatives demonstrate differing amounts of success. Their ability to inhibit cancer ranges widely. Studies of tissue-based pharmacokinetics of TAM and its derivatives provide direct concentration-effect relationships in tumors and critical normal tissues, thus providing a more rational basis for the evaluation of new compounds and tumor response to treatment (10, 11). Generally speaking, the study results are controversial. Imaging studies have shown that [18F]fluorotamoxifen is useful in predicting the effect of TAM therapy in patients with ER-positive breast cancer (12, 13). The 123I-trans-Z-iodomethyl-N,N-diethyltamoxifen has also been shown to be preferentially taken up by ER-positive tumors in patients with untreated primary breast cancer (14, 15). On the contrary, studies have failed to show the suitability for tumor localization of some derivatives, such as","","","","","","NBK23503 [bookaccession]","","PM:20641702","","","",""

IL-6 binds either to membrane or to soluble IL-6 receptor (IL-6sR), which then induces homodimerization of gp130 that activates downstream signaling. We tested the hypothesis that preoperative plasma IL-6 and IL-6sR levels are associated with prostate cancer stage, progression, and metastasis after radical prostatectomy. METHODS: Plasma levels of IL-6 and IL-6sR were measured in 120 consecutive patients who underwent radical prostatectomy for clinically localized prostate cancer, 44 healthy men without any cancer, 19 men with prostate cancer metastatic to the regional lymph nodes, and 10 men with prostate cancer metastatic to bone. RESULTS: Plasma IL-6 and IL-6sR levels were highest in patients with bone metastases (P <0.001). The preoperative IL-6 and IL-6sR levels were associated with the preoperative prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level (P </=0.041), prostatectomy tumor volume (P </=0.048), and final Gleason sum (P </=0.042). The preoperative IL-6 and IL-6sR levels and biopsy Gleason sum were independent predictors of PSA progression (P </=0.029). However, in a model that included both IL-6 and IL-6sR, only IL-6sR and the biopsy Gleason sum predicted progression (P </=0.040). In patients whose disease progressed, the preoperative IL-6 and IL-6sR levels were highest in those with presumed aggressive failure (P </=0.042). CONCLUSIONS: Plasma IL-6 and IL-6sR levels were dramatically elevated in the men with prostate cancer metastatic to bone. In patients with clinically localized prostate cancer, the preoperative plasma IL-6 and IL-6sR levels independently predicted biochemical progression after surgery, presumably because of an association with occult metastatic disease present at the time of radical prostatectomy","","","","","","S0090429501014054 [pii]","Baylor Prostate Center, Scott Department of Urology, Baylor College of Medicine and Methodist Hospital, Houston, Texas, USA","PM:11744478","","","",""

M. Slawin, et al., Cancer Res., 60: 7142-7148, 2000]. We evaluated the ability of preoperative peripheral blood RT-PCR for PSA and hK2 to predict prostate cancer progression after surgery. The study group consisted of 224 consecutive patients who underwent radical prostatectomy for clinically localized disease (median follow-up: 52.9 months). Also evaluated were 14 healthy men and 8 patients with hormone-naive, prostate cancer metastatic to bone. RT-PCR for PSA, hK2-L, and hK2-U were positive in 24, 25, and 26%, respectively, of prostatectomy patients; 88, 71, and 86%, respectively, of patients with metastases to bones; 7, 14, and 36%, respectively, of healthy men.

We tested whether elevated circulating levels of the angiogenesis-related markers vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and/or soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1) are associated with prostate cancer diagnosis, stage, progression, and metastasis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Plasma levels of VEGF and sVCAM-1 were measured on frozen, archival plasma obtained preoperatively from 215 consecutive patients who underwent radical prostatectomy for clinically localized disease, nine men with untreated prostate cancer metastatic to bones, and 40 healthy men without cancer. RESULTS: Plasma levels of both VEGF and sVCAM-1 were highest in patients with bone metastases (P <.001). VEGF levels were higher in patients with clinically localized disease than in healthy controls (P <.001). VEGF levels were elevated in patients with biopsy and final Gleason sum > or = 7 (P =.036 and P =.020, respectively) and extraprostatic extension (P =.047). Higher preoperative VEGF was independently associated with metastases to lymph nodes (P <.001).

Other hormonal interventions have a role in the treatment of prostate cancer. We sought to examine systematically the evidence for hormonal interventions in prostate cancer, risks of ADT, and interventions that mitigate these risks. Search results for therapeutic studies were focused primarily on randomized controlled clinical trials, and the Jadad scale criteria were used to evaluate the quality of these studies. Four trials of the efficacy of intermittent ADT versus continuous ADT were included. One randomized study analysis and six postrandomization analyses were included on the effects of ADT on cardiovascular mortality. Seven randomized controlled trials of pharmacologic interventions were included for the treatment of metabolic effects due to ADT. One randomized trial of GnRH antagonist versus GnRH agonist was included. Six phase I/II clinical trials of secondary hormonal therapies with novel mechanisms of action were included. Randomized studies completed to date indicate that intermittent ADT might be equivalent to continuous ADT. Although adverse effects of ADT include risk factors for cardiovascular disease, effects on cardiovascular mortality are uncertain. Bone loss and increased risk of fracture may be effectively treated with pharmacologic interventions.

Clinical management at this stage of the disease is palliative with systemic chemotherapy the main treatment of choice. A number of cytotoxic agents have shown activity in metastatic disease including cisplatin, methotrexate, doxorubicin and vinblastine. However, response rates still need improving and toxicities may sometimes be severe, and so the search for newer agents with improved benefit-to-risk ratios is constantly being pursued. One such agent that shows promise is gemcitabine. OBJECTIVES: Evaluate the effectiveness and toxicity of gemcitabine for the management of unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic bladder cancer. SEARCH STRATEGY: A search strategy was developed for MEDLINE to identify randomised trials of gemcitabine for the treatment of unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic bladder cancer. The searches were from 1966 to July 2010. Other databases searched included EMBASE, CINAHL, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, LILACS, and the Web of Science. There were no language or location restrictions. SELECTION CRITERIA: The titles and abstracts of the combined electronic and hand searching searches were manually screened by two authors to determine if they met the inclusion criteria of this review. Studies were selected if they were randomised, controlled trials or quasi-randomised clinical trials that included gemcitabine in at least one arm of a comparative study. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data extraction was carried out in duplicate by two authors. The information retrieved included the author's details, the study design, the characteristics of the recruited patients, details of the interventions and data relating to the primary and secondary outcomes measures. MAIN RESULTS: Three randomised trials used gemcitabine plus cisplatin (GCis) as one of the arms in each trial. The first randomised trial compared GCis with MVAC (methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin and cisplatin) and showed no significant difference in overall survival (hazard ratio1.09, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.34, P = 0.443) however the GCis regime had fewer incidences of neutropenic sepsis (1% versus 12%, P = 0.001) and mucositis (1% versus 22%, P = 0.001). A second randomised trial compared GCis to gemcitabine plus carboplatin (GCarbo) and reported an improved, but non-significant 1-year survival rate with GCis (64% versus 37%). A third randomised trial compared GCis with gemcitabine plus cisplatin plus paclitaxel (GCisPac) and again found no significant difference in overall survival (respective medians 49 weeks versus 61 weeks).One randomised trial evaluated GCarbo against methotrexate plus carboplatin plus vinblastine (MCarboV) in patients 'unfit' for cisplatin-based chemotherapy. There were more overall responses (38% versus 20%) and less severe acute toxicities (14% versus 23%) with GCarbo.In one randomised study evaluating 3-weekly gemcitabine plus paclitaxel (GPac3) versus a 2-weekly regimen overall survival was not significantly different (respective medians 13 and 9 months) however toxicities were worse with GPac3 especially alopecia (76% versus 32%).A larger trial compared gemcitabine (1 g/m2) (grams per metre squared) plus paclitaxel (175 mg/m2) (milligrams per metre squared) as a 3-weekly schedule for 6 cycles with a 2-weekly maintenance schedule. There was no significant difference in response rates, progression-free survival, disease-specific survival, and overall survival. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: A review of the published evidence found that one trial reported gemcitabine plus cisplatin had a better safety profile than MVAC and may be considered the first choice for treatment of metastatic bladder cancer. However, the data are limited to one trial only. Patients unable to tolerate cisplatin may benefit from gemcitabine plus carboplatin. GEMCITABINE FOR UNRESECTABLE, ADVANCED OR METASTATIC BLADDER CANCER: When bladder cancer has spread beyond the bladder and is unresectable or metastatic, the possibility of cure is severely diminished. Treatment at this stage of the disease aims to reduce the disease-related symptoms and to improve quality of life. Chemotherapy is the main treatment offered to patients with this condition and one drug that has recently shown activity is gemcitabine. This review aimed to determine the effectiveness and toxicity of gemcitabine by looking at the evidence published from randomised clinical trials. Patients receiving gemcitabine combined with cisplatin had a similar overall survival but less toxicity when compared to the well-established chemotherapeutic treatment of MVAC (methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, cisplatin). This suggests that gemcitabine plus cisplatin may be considered an alternative chemotherapy schedule to MVAC for advanced bladder cancer but the evidence is limited to one trial only. For patients who have poor kidney function or poor performance status the combination of gemcitabine plus carboplatin may be considered","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Accordingly, we have analyzed the effect of pattern 5 cancer on the prognosis of prostate cancer treated with Pd-103 brachytherapy. METHODS: Intermediate-risk patients with a Gleason score of 7 or higher and/or a prostate-specific antigen level of 10-20 ng/mL and whose biopsy slides were available for review were treated on a randomized trial. The regimens consisted of implantation with Pd 103 (90 vs 115 Gy [National Institute of Standards and Technology; NIST-1999]), combined with 44 Gy versus 20 Gy of supplemental beam radiation, respectively. Beam radiation was delivered with a four-field arrangement, designed to cover the prostate and seminal vesicles with a 2-cm margin (reduced to 1.0 cm posteriorly). Isotope implantation was per formed by standard techniques, using a modified peripheral loading pattern. All prostate biopsy specimens were reviewed for Gleason score by one investigator (L. T.). Along with assignment of a Gleason score based on established criteria, the presence of any pattern 5 cancer was separately noted and photographed for future review. Freedom from biochemical failure was defined as a serum prostate-specific antigen level < or = 0.5 ng/mL at last follow-up. Four of the 156 patients had insufficient PSA follow-up for inclusion, leaving 152 patients for cancer control analysis. RESULTS: Overall actuarial biochemical freedom from failure was 86% at 3 years, with 20 patients having experienced biochemical failure. Patients with or without Gleason pattern 5 cancer in their biopsy specimen had similar overall biochemical control. There was no obvious trend toward poorer overall biochemical cancer control in patients with pattern 5 cancer, regardless of whether the pretreatment prostate-specific antigen was less than or greater than 10 ng/mL. Of the 17 patients with biochemical failure, clinically evident bone metastases has developed in five. Three of these five patients who had a positive bone scan had pattern 5 cancer in their biopsy. CONCLUSIONS: Although the presence of pattern 5 disease may be a risk factor for early systemic failure, we are encouraged that high-dose, brachytherapy-based treatment seems to provide a high likelihood of biochemical cancer control, even in patients with the highest-grade cancer","","","","","","","Department of Radiation Oncology, Puget Sound Health Care System, Department of Veterans Affairs, Seattle, Washington 98108, USA","PM:15530259","","","",""

This lack of data, along with the feasibility of collecting DNM/IC, was examined in patients with AIPC who took part in a randomized trial using a newly developed questionnaire, the Collection of Indirect and Nonmedical Direct Costs (COIN) form. METHODS: Patients with AIPC were randomized to one of three treatment arms: 1) strontium only (strontium 4 Mci in Week 1 and Week 12) (STRONT); 2) vinblastine 4 mg/m(2) per week for 3 weeks then 1 week off and estramustine, 10 mg/kg per day (CHEMO); or 3) a combination of treatments outlined in the arms for CHEMO and STRONT (CHEMO/STRONT). Direct medical costs were collected through the hospital billing system. DNM/IC data were obtained prospectively using the COIN form. Cost data were analyzed for a period of 6 months. RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients were randomized, after which the protocol was closed because of poor accrual. The median survival of the patients was 22.3 months. The mean and median total costs for the 20 of 29 patients with complete cost information were $12,647 and $11,257 over 6 months, respectively. DNM/IC represented 11% of the total cost (range, from < 1% to 42%); in 20% of participating individuals, these costs accounted for 35-42% of total costs. Failure to collect complete cost information was due to early death, administrative difficulties, and loss to follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: In this pilot project, the collection of these cost data using the COIN form was feasible and practical and was limited primarily by logistic, not form specific, issues. DNM/IC were found to be a significant proportion of total costs (up to 42%) in selected patients, and this information proved to be a useful addition to the cost analysis. Approximately 98 patients would be required to detect a 20% difference in total costs between arms in a properly powered, randomized trial. Considering the potentially significant impact on total costs, DNM/IC data should be included in future cost-analysis studies of patients with AIPC and other diseases","","","","","","10.1002/1097-0142(20010215)91:4<841::AID-CNCR1072>3.0.CO;2-B [pii]","Division of Solid Tumor Oncology, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, 1275 York Avenue, New York, NY 10021, USA","PM:11241254","","","",""

We examined the rate of decline in hip BMD and identified factors associated with BMD loss among 1478 Afro-Caribbean men >or=40 yr of age. BMD was measured at baseline and after an average of 4.4 yr by DXA. The rate of decline in femoral neck BMD was 0.29 +/- 0.81%/yr in the total sample (p < 0.0001). However, a U-shaped relationship between advancing age and the rate of decline in BMD was observed. The rate of decline in BMD at the femoral neck was -0.38 +/- 0.77%/yr among men 40-44 yr of age, decelerated to -0.15 +/- 0.81%/yr among men 50-54 yr of age, and then accelerated to -0.52 +/- 0.90%/yr among those 75+ yr of age (all p < 0.003). Men who lost >or=5% of their body weight during follow-up had significantly greater BMD loss than those who remained weight stable or gained weight (p < 0.0001). The relationship between weight loss and BMD loss was more pronounced among men who were older and leaner at study entry (p < 0.03). We also observed a strong impact of advanced prostate cancer and its treatment with androgen deprivation on BMD loss. Men of African ancestry experience substantial BMD loss with advancing age that seems to be comparable to the rate of loss among white men in other studies. Additional studies are needed to better define the natural history and factors underlying bone loss with aging in men of African ancestry","","","","","","10.1359/jbmr.090221 [doi]","Department of Epidemiology, Graduate School of Public Health, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15261, USA","PM:19257828","","","",""

To understand which groups respond well or poorly to endocrine therapy is thus important. Several studies have shown that pretreatment serum testosterone (T) levels and the length of the CAG repeat at the N-terminal region of the androgen receptor are significant. However, the relevance of a combination of these factors has not been reported. We therefore investigated the clinical significance of CAG repeat length and pretreatment serum T levels among Japanese patients with metastatic prostate cancer (TxNxM1), and analyzed their relevance to survival. Methods: Fifty-two Japanese patients with metastatic prostate cancer were enrolled in this study. We determined the length of the CAG repeat by both PCR sequencing and fragment analysis. Pretreatment serum T levels were measured using a radioimmunoassay. We examined the clinical significance of the CAG repeats and T levels individually and in combination with respect to several clinical factors. Results: The pretreatment T level in the responder group was significantly higher than that in the non-responders (p = 0.009) and the mean was 4.33 +/- 2.12 ng/ml. Kaplan-Meier analyses revealed that cause-specific survival was significantly enhanced in patients with higher levels of T (p = 0.0489). The length of the CAG repeat was positively associated with age at diagnosis (p = 0.032). The mean CAG repeat length was 22.5 +/- 3.0 and this value was significantly shorter in patients with poorly differentiated, than with well and moderately differentiated tumors (p = 0.019). Kaplan-Meier analyses revealed a significantly better cause-specific survival rate as well as progression-free survival rate in patients with longer CAG repeats. Cause-specific survival curves were better in patients with higher T levels and longer CAG repeats than with lower T levels and shorter CAG repeats (p = 0.0066). A multivariate analysis showed that the most si gnificant prognostic factor was histological grade, followed by EOD grade, marker response and the combination of T and CAG. Conclusion: Pretreatment serum T levels together with the length of the N-terminal CAG repeat of the androgen receptor gene can distinguish responders from non-responders to androgen ablation. These parameters appear to be clinically useful, in that therapies appropriate to individual patients could be selected. Further studies are necessary to confirm these results. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Many approaches are currently being evaluated to improve the treatment of this condition. These include drugs that induce androgen deprivation, that is, LHRH antagonists; more active or less toxic chemotherapy agents; immunologic approaches, including passive and active immunization; drugs that target the androgen receptor and/or androgen synthesis; drugs that target specific pathways, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors, angiogenesis i nhibitors, endothelin antagonists and matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors; and antioxidants and cell cycle inhibitors.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 103 men with localized or locally advanced prostate cancer (T1-T4, Nx, M0) for whom immediate androgen deprivation was indicated were enrolled in this prospective, multicenter, open-label, parallel group study. Patients were randomized to bicalutamide 150 mg once daily (51) or medical castration with a luteinizing hormone releasing hormone analogue (52) for 96 weeks. Primary end points were mean percent change from baseline in lumbar spine BMD, hip BMD and FFM at 96 weeks. Mean changes in lipid parameters with time were also evaluated. RESULTS: BMD was maintained during bicalutamide 150 mg monotherapy (+2.42% for lumbar spine BMD and +1.13% for hip BMD at week 96), while castration was associated with a progressive loss in BMD (-5.40% and -4.39% at week 96, respectively, both p <0.0001 at week 96). There was no significant difference between bicalutamide 150 mg and castration in mean percent change from baseline in FFM (-1.56% and -3.86%, respectively, at week 96, p = 0.31), although there was a trend for greater progressive loss over time with castration. Mean changes in lipid parameters were small and similar in the 2 groups.

A first selected compound, BZA, was studied in a phase 2 clinical trial on 159 patients as an imaging agent for the detection of primary melanoma and metastases with good results. We report the results of a second phase 2 clinical trial on 40 patients with a new radiopharmaceutical BZA2 (an orthoiodinated BZA analog), which was expected to provide quality images sooner after injection and with better imaging contrast. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Performance was evaluated in 40 patients classified with primary ocular lesions (12), suspicion of metastases of ocular or cutaneous origin (15), or with no known secondary lesion (13), and results were compared with conventional investigation techniques (ophthalmoscopy, ultrasonography, and angiography for ocular melanoma, whole-body CT scan and ultrasonography for metastases). RESULTS: No adverse events were recorded. The overall results on a per patient basis showed a sensitivity of 78% and a specificity of 95%. The four false negatives observed were ocular lesions (three with a thickness<3mm and one achromic), but all the proven secondary lesions were imaged. Moreover, negative BZA2 scintigraphy in cases of suspicious lesions led to the correction of two diagnoses: the prostatic origin of bone metastases and the endocrine tumor origin (APUD system) of an ocular lesion. DISCUSSION: BZA2 scintigraphy is an easy test with good tolerance. In the diagnosis of ocular primary melanoma, the sensitivity of the test is 64%, although limited by the thickness (3mm) and the pigmentation of the lesion. However, the BZA2 scintigraphy is a very useful test for the detection of melanoma metastases, with a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 95%. CONCLUSION: BZA2 scintigraphy showed good tolerance in patients and it appears promising for differential diagnosis, staging, and restaging of melanoma","","","","","","MDOI-JFO-01-2004-27-1-0181-5512-101019-ART6 [pii]","Service d'Ophtalmologie, CHU, Hopital Gabriel Montpied, Clermont-Ferrand","PM:14968075","","","",""

Although small degrees of incidental incontinence may go virtually unnoticed, larger degrees of incontinence can have a major impact on a man's quality of life.Conceptually, postprostatectomy incontinence may be caused by sphincter malfunction and/or bladder dysfunction. The majority of men with post-prostatectomy incontinence (60 to 100%) have stress urinary incontinence, which is the complaint of involuntary urinary leakage on effort or exertion, or on sneezing or coughing. This may be due to intrinsic sphincter deficiency and may be treated with surgery for optimal management of incontinence. Detrusor dysfunction is more common after surgery for benign prostatic disease. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effects of surgical treatment for urinary incontinence related to presumed sphincter deficiency after prostate surgery for either benign LUTS secondary to BPH (transurethral resection of prostate (TURP), photo vaporization of the prostate, laser enucleation of the prostate and open prostatectomy) or radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer (retropubic, perineal, laparoscopic, or robotic). SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Register (searched 28 June 2010), MEDLINE (January 1966 to January 2010), EMBASE (January 1988 to January 2010), LILACS (January 1982 to January 2010) and the reference lists of relevant articles, handsearched conference proceedings and contacted investigators to locate studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised or quasi-randomised trials that include surgical treatments of urinary incontinence after prostate surgery. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently screened the trials identified, appraised quality of papers and extracted data. MAIN RESULTS: Only one study with 45 participants met the inclusion criteria. Men were divided in two subgroups (minimal or total incontinence) and each group was randomized to artificial urethral sphincter (AUS) implantation or Macroplastique injection. Follow-up ranged from six to 120 months. In the trial as a whole, the men treated with AUS were more likely to be dry (18/20, 82%) than those who had the injectable treatment (11/23, 46%) (OR 5.67, 95% CI 1.28 to 25.10). However, this effect was only statistically significant for the men with more severe ('total') incontinence (OR 8.89, 95% CI 1.40 to 56.57) and the confidence intervals were wide. There were more severe complications in the group undergoing AUS, and the costs were higher. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The evidence available at present is limited because only one small randomised clinical trial was identified. Although the result is favourable for the implantation of AUS in the group with severe incontinence, this result should be considered with caution due to the small sample size and uncertain methodological quality of the study found. SURGERY FOR URINARY INCONTINENCE DUE TO PRESUMED SPHINCTER DEFICIENCY AFTER PROSTATE SURGERY: Urinary incontinence after prostatectomy for benign or malignant disease is a well known and often feared outcome. Although a small amount of incontinence may not cause a problem, larger degrees of incontinence can have a major impact on a man's quality of life. Improvement in urinary continence may occur six to 12 months after the prostatic surgery, but for men with persistent bothersome incontinence despite conservative therapy, surgery may be offered.This review looked for trials that had considered the effectiveness of the surgical treatments of urinary incontinence after prostate surgery. There are five main types of surgery and, despite some of them being in use for more than two decades, only one trial that met the inclusion criteria was found. There was some weak evidence that the implantation of an artificial urinary sphincter might be more effective than injectable treatment, but with more adverse effects and higher costs. There was no evidence about the other types of surgery","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods and Materials: The treatment and outcome of 369 eligible patients with Stage T1-T3aN0-NXM0 prostate cancer were analyzed during a minimal 10-year follow-up period. All patients were treated with curative intent to a mean dose of 65 Gy. The full history of any metastatic disease was documented for each subject, including the initial site of involvement, any progression over time, and pati ent survival. Results: The overall survival rate for the 369 patients was 75% at 5 years and 45% at 10 years. The overall survival rate of patients who never developed metastases was 90% and 81% at 5 and 10 years, respectively. However, among the 74 patients (20%) who developed metastases, the survival rate at both 5 and 10 years was significantly reduced (p <0.0001). The overall survival rate for patients who developed bone metastases was 58% and 27% at 5 and 10 years, respectively, and patients with bone metastases to the pelvis fared worse compared with those with vertebral metastases. With regard to the metastatic number, patients with <=5 metastatic lesions had superior survival rates relative to those with >5 lesions (73% and 36% at 5 and 10 years vs. 45% and 18% at 5 and 10 years, respectively; p = 0.02). In addition, both the metastasis-free survival rate and the interval measured from the date of the initial diagnosis of prostate cancer to the development of bone metastasis were statistically superior for patients with <=5 lesions compared with patients with >5 lesions (p = 0.01 and 0.02, respectively). However, the survival rate and the interval from the date of diagnosis of bone metastasis to the time of death for patients in both groups were not significantly different, statistically (p = 0.17 and 0.27, respectively). Conclusion: Patients with <=5 metastatic sites had significantly better survival rates than patients with >5 lesions. Because existing sites of metastatic disease may be the primary sites of origin for additional metastases, our findings suggest that early detection and aggressive treatment of patients with a small number of metastatic lesions is worth testing as an approach to improving long-term survival.

Metastasis-free survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and factors predictive of progression-free survival were estimated using the proportional hazards model. A nomogram based on the Cox model was constructed. Results: Metastatic events were documented in 74% (110 of 148) of patients during the follow-up period. The median progression-free survival was 19 months, with 3- and 5-year metastatic progression-free survival of 32% and 16%, respectively. T stage (P = 0.07) and Gleason grade (P = 0.006) at the time of diagnosis, PSA values at the time of protocol entry (P < 0.001), and PSA doubling time (P < 0.001) were associated with progression in univariate ana lysis. These were combined into a nomogram to assess risk for an individual patient. Conclusions: Tumor characteristics at the time of diagnosis, PSA doubling time following relapse, and the PSA value at the time of the protocol are predictive of metastatic progression. Because the PSA value at the time of monitoring was predictive, early treatment to prevent metastatic progression is favored.

The secondary endpoint was to assess the efficacy of cetuximab in combination with doxorubicin as well as to determine the optimal biologic dose and the maximum tolerated dose. Patients and Methods: Patients in 8 groups received escalating doses of cetuximab 20-300 mg/m<sup>2</sup> plus doxorubicin 15 or 20 mg/m<sup>2</ sup> given intravenously weekly for 6 consecutive weeks, followed by a 1-week observation period. A treatment response was defined as a > 50% decline in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) or regression of radiographically measurable disease. Results: Of the 36 treated pati ents, 25% had grade 2 neutropenia, 39% had leukopenia, and 44% had stomatitis at doxorubicin 20 mg/m<sup>2</ sup>.

The epothilone B analog BMS-247550 is a novel microtubule agent that has shown activity in taxane-resistant tumors. We conducted a dose-escalation study to determine a safe dose of BMS-247550 to combine with EMP in patients with metastatic prostate cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Chemotherapy-naive patients with castrate-metastatic prostate cancer were treated with intravenous BMS-247550 and oral EMP (280 mg three times daily for 5 days) every 3 weeks. RESULTS: Thirteen patients were treated at two dose levels (35 and 40 mg/m(2)). Three of six patients treated at 40 mg/m(2) developed grade 4 neutropenia, establishing 35 mg/m(2) as the maximum-tolerated dose. Significant peripheral neuropathy (grade >/= 2) was related to dose level and infusion rate. A decline in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) of >/= 50% was seen in 11 of 12 evaluable patients (92%) (95% confidence interval 76% to 100%). There were objective responses in soft tissue (57%) and bone metastasis (40%). CONCLUSIONS: The phase II dose of BMS-247550 combined with EMP is 35 mg/m(2) over 3 h every 3 weeks.

Pain is common in these patients. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of an intravenous bisphosphonate, pamidronate disodium, on pain control in metastatic prostate cancer patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials were conducted in patients with bone pain due to metastatic prostate cancer, with disease progression after first-line hormonal therapy. Intravenous pamidronate disodium (90 mg) or placebo was administered every 3 weeks for 27 weeks. Efficacy was measured via self-reported pain score (Brief Pain Inventory), analgesic use, the proportion of patients with a skeletal-related event (SRE; defined as pathologic fracture, radiation or surgery to bone, spinal cord compression, or hypercalcemia), and a pilot quantitative measurement of mobility. Laboratory evaluations included serum prostate-specific antigen, interleukin-6, bone alkaline phosphatase, and urinary bone resorption markers. RESULTS: Results of the two trials were pooled. There were no sustained significant differences between the pamidronate and placebo groups in self-reported pain measurements, analgesic use, proportion of patients with an SRE, or mobility at week 9 or 27. Urinary bone resorption markers were suppressed in the pamidronate group compared with placebo. CONCLUSION: Pamidronate disodium failed to demonstrate a significant overall treatment benefit compared with placebo in palliation of bone pain or reduction of SREs. Evaluation of more potent bisphosphonates in patients with prostate cancer is warranted","","","","","","10.1200/JCO.2003.05.147 [doi];JCO.2003.05.147 [pii]","UCSF Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California, San Francisco, 1600 Divisadero St, A718, San Francisco, CA 94115, USA. smalle@medicine.ucsf.edu","PM:14581438","","","",""

The immunotherapy, based on the GVAX platform, is a combination of two prostate carcinoma cell lines modified with the granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) gene. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: HRPC patients with radiologic metastases (n = 34) or rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA) only (n = 21) received a prime dose of 500 million cells and 12 boost doses of either 100 million cells (low dose) or 300 million cells (high dose) biweekly for 6 months. End points were changes in PSA, time to progression, and survival. RESULTS: Median survival was 26.2 months (95% confidence interval, 17, 36) in the radiologic group: 34.9 months (8, 57) after treatment with the high dose (n = 10) of immunotherapy and 24.0 months (11, 35) with the low dose (n = 24). The median time to bone scan progression in the radiologic group was 5.0 months (2.6, 11.6) with the high dose and 2.8 months (2.8, 5.7) with the low dose. In the rising-PSA group (n = 21) receiving the low dose, the median time to bone scan progression was 5.9 months (5.6, not reached), and median survival was 37.5 months (29, 56). No dose-limiting or autoimmune toxicities were seen; the most common adverse events were injection site reaction and fatigue. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that this GM-CSF-secreting, allogeneic cellular immunotherapy is well tolerated and may have clinical activity in patients with metastatic HRPC.

The incidence of prostate cancer has approximately doubled. Many countries especially in Western Europe, North America and including Australia report decreases in prostate cancer mortality due to this change ranging from 10 to 39%. This has not so far occurred in New Zealand, however, and likely reasons for this are discussed. They include a negative approach encouraged by the New Zealand Guidelines Group and others, and more difficult access to i nvestigations and treatments for New Zealand men than other countries. Technological advances in TRUS sector biopsy, histological diagnosis, and management are discussed. Changes in international prostate cancer mortality data and results from several clinical trials are also discussed. It is concluded that the weight of evidence in favour of PSA/DRE testing is now overwhelming and that potentially between 200 and 300 of the 600 men who currently die of prostate cancer in New Zealand could be saved by the application of current technology.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Ninety-five patients were randomized to (89)Sr (Arm A) or saline (Arm B) on Day 1 of EBRT to demonstrate a reduction in 3-month physician-assessed subjective progression from 70% to 45%. RESULTS: At 3 and 6 months, no difference between treatment arms was observed in the progression rate. At 3 months, the physician-assessed response rate for all patients was 25%, with 46% of the patients progressing. The pretreatment use of opiates was independently associated with short progression-free survival. On the basis of the quality-of-life assessments, pain relief occurred in 50% of patients and 32% experienced improvement in global quality of life, without impact from (89)Sr. Differences were observed between the physician evaluation of radiotherapy efficacy and the patient assessment. In Arm A, serum alkaline phosphatase, but not serum prostate-specific antigen, decreased during the first 3 months after treatment. CONCLUSION: (89)Sr, adjuvant to ERBT, does not seem to reduce the number of patients with subjective progression at 3 months.

More recently, SUP 177Lu has emerged as an attractive radionuclide for use in systemic radiotherapy. Like SUP 131I, it has a longer half-live than SUP 90Y which is more suitable to the pharmacokinetics of monoclonal antibodies, but its chemistry is similar to SUP 90Y and, when internalized, it is retained by the tumor whereas SUP 131I can be quickly released. Metastatic prostate cancer is an attractive target for radioimmunotherapy since the cornerstone of current therapy is hormonal therapy, which is only palliative. Prostate cancer is also known to metastasize to areas such as the lymph nodes and bone marrow, sites that are readily accessible to circulating monoclonal antibodies. This review will look at recent advances to the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer with radiolabeled antibodies with a specific emphasis on SUP 177Lu-huJ591, a labeled monoclonal antibody currently under clinical evaluation","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we show that dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scanning provides clinically useful information about the status of metastatic bone lesions in cancer patients undergoing palliative treatment. In the study group of 21 patients, a significant increase in metastatic bone mineral density (BMD) was confirmed in prostate (n = 14) relative to breast (n = 7) cancer patients. With respect to the prostate cancer cohort, further increases in lesional BMD were evident in all evaluable patients in whom biochemical progression occurred; conversely, lesional BMD declined in patients who had a partial response to therapy. BMD of uninvolved bone decreased with all types of androgen-deprivation therapy regardless of whether patients responded or relapsed. We conclude that BMD changes in both lesional and uninvolved bone are readily detectable in metastatic prostate cancer, and propose that DXA scanning represents a promising new approach to monitoring the natural history and therapeutic course of this disease","","","","","","","Department of Metabolic Medicine, Imperial College School of Medicine, London, UK","PM:11467770","","","",""

We conducted a controlled study of the prevention of osteoporosis in men undergoing treatment with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist. METHODS: In a 48-week, open-label study, we randomly assigned 47 men with advanced or recurrent prostate cancer and no bone metastases to receive either leuprolide alone or leuprolide and pamidronate (60 mg intravenously every 12 weeks). Bone mineral density of the lumbar spine and the proximal femur was measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Trabecular bone mineral density of the lumbar spine was measured by quantitative computed tomography. Forty-one men completed the study. RESULTS: In men treated with leuprolide alone, the mean (+/-SE) bone mineral density decreased by 3.3+/-0.7 percent in the lumbar spine, 2.1+/-0.6 percent in the trochanter, and 1.8+/-0.4 percent in the total hip, and the mean trabecular bone mineral density of the lumbar spine decreased by 8.5+/-1.8 percent (P<0.001 for each comparison with the base-line value). In contrast, the mean bone mineral density did not change significantly at any skeletal site in men treated with both leuprolide and pamidronate. There were significant differences between the two groups in the mean changes in bone mineral density at 48 weeks in the lumbar spine (P<0.001), trochanter (P = 0.003), total hip (P=0.005), and trabecular bone of the lumbar spine (P=0.02).

Pathological osteoclast activation plays a central role in both disease and treatment-related skeletal morbidity. Bisphosphonates, potent inhibitors of osteoclast activity, are now an important part of the management for many men with prostate cancer. Zoledronic acid, a potent intravenous bisphosphonate, decreases the risk of skeletal complications in men with hormone-refractory prostate cancer and bone metastases. Zoledronic acid and pamidronate preserve bone mineral density in men receiving ADT for nonmetastatic prostate cancer.

Bone mineral density and body composition were measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry and quantitative computed tomography. RESULTS: Mean (+/- standard error) bone mineral density of the posterior-anterior lumbar spine decreased by 2.5% +/- 0.5% in the leuprolide group and increased by 2.5 +/- 0.5 in the bicalutamide group from baseline to 12 months (P <.001). Mean changes in bone mineral density of the total body, total hip, femoral neck, and trabecular bone of the lumbar spine also differed significantly between groups (P < or =.003 for each comparison). Fat mass increased by 11.1% +/- 1.3% in the leuprolide group and by 6.4% +/- 1.1% in the bicalutamide group (P =.01).

One of the main causes of this is hypogonadism, in turn brought upon by early androgen deprivation therapy used in prostate cancer treatment. Androgen deprivation therapy produces a host of adverse effects on the skeleton, including an increase in bone turnover, a decrease in bone mineral density, and an increase in fracture risk. In addition, based on observations in preclinical models, these adverse effects on the skeletal integrity may promote the development of or progression of metastasis to bone. Loss of bone due to androgen deprivation therapy is an important clinical issue for many men with prostate cancer, but osteoporosis is not an inevitable consequence of androgen deprivation therapy. Because of interpatient variations in peak bone mass as well as differences in rates of treatment-related bone loss, not all men with prostate cancer require treatment for osteoporosis. All men on androgen deprivation therapy should receive calcium and multivitamin supplements and should be considered for bisphosphonate therapy; this is particularly so for men with either a low baseline BMD or observed high rates of bone loss during androgen deprivation therapy","","","","","","","Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA. smith.matthew@mgh.harvard.edu","PM:15202584","","","",""

Bisphosphonates are a standard part of supportive care for patients with bone metastases. Zoledronic acid, a nitrogen containing third generation bisphosphonate, is the most active and is the most thoroughly investigated bisphosphonate for metastatic bone disease. The efficacy and safety of zoledronic acid has been established in three pivotal prospective, randomized controlled trials involving more than 3000 subjects. The evidence is reviewed here with a focus on clinical relevance. Across a broad array of tumour types, zoledronic acid (4 mg intravenously over 15 min every 3-4 weeks) decreased the frequency of skeletal-related events, delayed the time to a first skeletal-related event, and reduced pain.

RESULTS: At 2 years, 33% of patients had developed bone metastases. Median bone metastasis-free survival was 30 months. Median time to first bone metastases and overall survival were not reached. Baseline PSA level greater than 10 ng/mL (relative risk, 3.18; 95% CI, 1.74 to 5.80; P < .001) and PSA velocity (4.34 for each 0.01 increase in PSA velocity; 95% CI, 2.30 to 8.21; P < .001) independently predicted shorter time to first bone metastasis. Baseline PSA and PSA velocity also independently predicted overall survival and metastasis-free survival. Other covariates did not consistently predict clinical outcomes. CONCLUSION: Men with nonmetastatic prostate cancer and rising PSA despite androgen deprivation therapy have a relatively indolent natural history. Baseline PSA and PSA velocity independently predict time to first bone metastasis and survival","","","","","","23/13/2918 [pii];10.1200/JCO.2005.01.529 [doi]","Massachusetts General Hospital, Cox 640, 100 Blossom St, Boston, MA 02114, USA. smith.matthew@mgh.harvard.edu","PM:15860850","","","",""

Hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC) remains true to its name: it is largely refractory to attempts to delay its progression. Although the number of men presenting with metastatic prostate cancer has decreased significantly over the last several years, the death rate for those men is essentially unchanged. To alter the currently inevitable progression of HRPC to death, new targets and new therapies are needed.

These analyses were designed to identify the variables associated with a greater risk of skeletal complications. METHODS: The 643 subjects in this report were participants in a randomized placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the effects of zoledronic acid on the incidence of skeletal-related events. All subjects had bone metastases and disease progression despite medical or surgical castration. The relationships between the baseline covariates and the time to the first skeletal-related event were assessed by Cox proportional hazard analyses. The serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP) and urinary N-telopeptide level was assessed as a representative specific marker of osteoblastic and osteoclastic activity, respectively. The other covariates included in the model were age, cancer duration, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, analgesic use, and prostate-specific antigen, hemoglobin, and lactate dehydrogenase levels. RESULTS: Elevated BAP levels were consistently associated with a greater risk of adverse skeletal outcomes. Elevated BAP was significantly associated with a shorter time to the first skeletal-related event on multivariate analyses of the entire study population (relative risk 1.84, 95% confidence interval 1.40 to 2.43; P <0.001) and in subset analyses of the placebo and zoledronic acid groups. Elevated BAP levels were also consistently associated with adverse skeletal outcomes on multivariate analyses of the time to radiotherapy and pathologic fracture, the most common types of skeletal-related events in the study population. No other baseline variable was consistently associated with the risk of adverse skeletal outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study have shown that elevated serum BAP levels are associated with a greater risk of adverse skeletal outcomes in men with hormone-refractory prostate cancer and bone metastases","","","","","","S0090-4295(07)00420-7 [pii];10.1016/j.urology.2007.03.071 [doi]","Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts 02114, USA. smith.matthew@mgh.harvard.edu","PM:17826496","","","",""

Although typical bone metastases from prostate cancer appear osteoblastic by radiographic imaging, excess number and activity of both osteoblasts and osteoclasts characterize most 'osteoblastic' bone metastases. Additionally, pathological osteoclast activation is associated with increased risk of skeletal complications, disease progression, and death. Zoledronic acid, a potent intravenous bisphosphonate, reduces markers of osteoclast activity and significantly decreases the risk of skeletal complications in men with androgen-independent prostate cancer and bone metastases. Additional studies are needed to determine the optimal timing, schedule, and duration of bisphosphonate treatment in men with bone metastases as well as the potential role of bisphosphonates in other settings, including the prevention of bone metastases. Denosumab is a human monoclonal antibody that binds and neutralizes human receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand (RANKL), a critical mediator of osteoclast activation, differentiation, and survival. Three ongoing pivotal studies involving more than 4,500 subjects will evaluate the role of denosumab for prevention of treatment-related fractures, bone metastases, and disease-related skeletal complications in men with prostate cancer.

Objective: To assess the impact of androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) on bone and to outline recently reported and ongoing phase 3 studies of agents designed to prevent bone loss and fractures in men with PCa. Evidence acquisition: This article is based on a presentation at an Amgen-sponsored satellite symposium held at the European Association of Urology Congress in Stockholm, Sweden, in March 2009. Evidence synthesis: ADT for PCa is associated with bone loss and an increased fracture risk. Several bisphosphonates have been shown to improve bone mineral density (BMD) during ADT, but their effects on treatment-related fractures are unknown. Denosumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody to RANK Ligand, is being investigated for the management of bone loss associated with PCa. The results of a phase 3 randomised, placebo-controlled trial of denosumab to prevent bone loss and fractures during ADT in men with PCa have recently been reported. Compared with placebo, denosumab (60 mg subcutaneously every 6 mo) significantly reduced the incidence of new vertebral fractures by 62% after 3 yr. Denosumab also increased BMD significantly at various skeletal sites, including the spine, hip, and wrist. Conclusions: ADT decreases BMD and increases fracture risk in men with PCa. A recent phase 3 study has demonstrated that denosumab increases BMD and significantly reduces the risk of new vertebral fractures in men with PCa. Two ongoing phase 3 studies are evaluating denosumab for the prevention and treatment of bone metastases in men with castration-resistant prostate cancer.

We investigated the effects of denosumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody against receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand, on bone mineral density and fractures in men receiving androgen-deprivation therapy for nonmetastatic prostate cancer. Methods: In this double-blind, multicenter study, we randomly assigned patients to receive denosumab at a dose of 60 mg subcutaneously every 6 months or placebo (734 patients in each group). The primary end point was percent change in bone mineral density at the lumbar spine at 24 months. Key secondary end points included percent change in bone mineral densities at the femoral neck and total hip at 24 months and at all three sites at 36 months, as well as incidence of new vertebral fractures. Results: At 24 months, bone mineral density of the lumbar spine had increased by 5.6% in the denosumab group as compared with a loss of 1.0% in the placebo group (P<0.001); significant differences between the two groups were seen at as early as 1 month and sustained through 36 months. Denosumab therapy was also associated with significant increases in bone mineral density at the total hip, femoral neck, and distal third of the radiu s at all time points. Patients who received denosumab had a decreased incidence of new vertebral fractures at 36 months (1.5%, vs. 3.9% with placebo) (relative risk, 0.38; 95% confidence interval, 0.19 to 0.78; P=0.006). Rates of adverse events were similar between the two groups. Conclusions: Denosumab was associated with increased bone mineral density at all sites and a reduction in the incidence of new vertebral fractures among men receiving androgen-deprivation therapy for nonmetastatic prostate cancer.

The potential of bone scintigraphy to predict skeletal-related events, particularly spinal cord compression, after the onset of hormone refractoriness has never been investigated. The aim of this study was to establish whether a new method of evaluating bone scintigraphy would offer a better predictive value for this complication of the metastatic process than is achieved with currently available grading methods. We studied 84 patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer who had undergone bone scintigraphy at the time of hormone escape. Tumour grading and parameters of tumour load (PSA and alkaline phosphatase activity) were available in all patients. The incidence of spinal cord compression was documented and all patients were followed up until death. Bone scintigraphy was evaluated by the conventional Soloway grading and by an additional analysis determining total or partial involvement of individual vertebrae. In contrast to the Soloway method, the new method was able to predict spinal cord compression at various spinal levels. Our data suggest that there is still a place for bone scintigraphy in the management of hormone-refractory prostate cancer","","","","","","10.1007/s00259-004-1479-z [doi]","Department of Urology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands","PM:14985870","","","",""

To improve the therapeutic efficacy and reduce the toxicity of TEC, the authors substituted intravenous (i.v.) EMP for oral EMP based on single-agent studies demonstrating an improved safety profile with i.v. EMP. METHODS: Patients with progressive, castrate, metastatic prostate carcinoma were treated with up to 6 4-week cycles of i.v. EMP (500-1500 mg/m(2) per week), paclitaxel (100 mg/m(2) per week), and carboplatin (target area under the curve = 6 mg/mL every 4 weeks). RESULTS: Thirty patients were treated in 6 dose cohorts. Deep venous thrombosis occurred in 5 of 30 patients (17%). Other common Grade 3/4 (according to National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria) toxicities included hepatic toxicity (23%) and leukopenia (24%). Posttherapy prostate specific antigen declines > 50% were seen in 18 of 30 patients (60%), and declines > 80% were seen in 15 of 30 patients (50%). Eleven of 17 patients (65%) with measurable soft tissue disease achieved a partial response. Four of 27 patients (15%) with osseous metastases demonstrated improvement on bone scan. CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous EMP was administered safely with paclitaxel and carboplatin and produced clinical outcomes similar to the outcomes achieved with the TEC regimen. Substitution of i.v. EMP for the oral formulation was found to result in a lower incidence of severe nausea but increased hepatic toxicity","","","","","","10.1002/cncr.11754 [doi]","Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10021, USA","PM:14584065","","","",""

Materials and Methods: Data from a prospective, randomized, double-blind study with a median follow-up of 160 weeks were used to perform an exploratory analysis of outcome with 2 combined androgen blockade regimens in 813 advanced prostate cancer patients based on disease status at entry (minimal or extensive disease). A total of 404 patients received bicalutamide plus LHRHa, and 409 patients received flutamide plus LHRHa. Patients were grouped prospectively by 'extent of disease' as determined by bone scan: minimal disease was defined as zero to five lesions, while extensive disease was defined as greater than or equal to six lesions. Patients with no lesions on bone scan (0 lesions) had to have at least one measurable nonskeletal metastasis. Results: Patients with minimal disease receiving bicalutamide plus LHRHa demonstrated a trend to longer survival as reflected by a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.79 (95% confidence interval 0.59-1.07), but this was not statistically significant. In the extensive disease group, the effects of bicalutamide plus LHRHa and flutamide plus LHRHa on disease progression and survival were similar (HR 0.96 and 0.90, respectively). Conclusions: Our results are consistent with previously published data demonstrating that patients with stage D SUB 2 prostate cancer and minimal disease have a better outcome than patients with extensive disease. In the patients with minimal disease per bone scan, there was a trend toward a benefit for bicalutamide plus LHRHa compared with flutamide plus LHRHa in terms of survival, but not in terms of disease progression","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent Findings: Two novel agents have been added to the therapeutic armamentarium including cabazitaxel and sipuleucel-T. Cabazitaxel, a novel taxane extended survival in men with progressive metastatic CRPC following conventional docetaxel-based chemotherapy. Sipuleucel-T, an autologous dendritic cell based vaccine extended survival in men with relatively asymptom atic metastatic CRPC without visceral metastasis. A third agent, abiraterone acetate, an orally administered CYP17 inhibitor, which suppresses androgen synthesis has been preliminarily reported to significantly prolong survival following prior docetaxel and approval by regulatory agencies is anticipated. Baseline and early changes in circulating tumor cells appear useful as a prognostic factor. Additionally, data demonstrated the superiority of denosumab, a RANK-ligand antagonist, compared to zoledronic acid in the prevention of skeletal related events in men with bone metastases. Summary: Cab azitaxel, sipuleucel-T and denosumab were approved in 2010 by regulatory agencies in the USA for men with metastatic CRPC, and approval of abiraterone acetate is anticipated based on the results of a phase III trial. The evaluation of circulating tumor cells assists in determining prognosis, although its utility for clinical decision-making entails validation.

Methods: Urologic experts in the field of PCa selected relevant new findings that were discussed during a closed meeting in September 2006. The key points are communicated in this paper. Results: There was much discussion about the relevance of Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) screening. There seems to be no specific threshold for early detection of clinically relevant PCa. PSA doubling time and PSA velocity may be more reliable to predict the risk of disease progression in patients with PCa. The first randomised controlled trial showed a comparable survival rate and risk of disease progression for external-beam radiation therapy and radical prostatectomy in patients with clinically localised PCa. In patients with advanced PCa, intermittent hormone therapy does not increase the risk of disease progression compared to continuous hormone therapy, while it has less impact on patient's quality of life. Patients receiving hormone therapy may benefit from an annual single-dose injection of zoledronic acid for the prevention of bone complications. Besides PSA, testosterone levels should be monitored in patients on androgen-deprivation treatment. Conclusions: Many interesting data in the field of PCa have been presented at this year's uro-oncologic meetings, which will improve the management of patients with PCa.

There have been no head-to-head clinical trials comparing pamidronate and zoledronic acid among patients with advanced prostate cancer. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the risk of developing an SRE among men with metastatic prostate cancer after being treated with either pamidronate or zoledronic acid. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted, using data from Kaiser Permanente's Southern California Region. The cohort included men aged > or = 18 years diagnosed with prostate cancer from 1998 to 2004 who received at least 1 infusion of either pamidronate or zoledronic acid after their cancer diagnosis. Patients receiving both drugs and those with a documented SRE prior to diagnosis were excluded. The primary outcome of SREs was defined using diagnosis codes for fractures, spinal cord compression, radiation to bone, and hypercalcemia of malignancy. Secondary outcomes were deterioration in renal function, based on serum creatinine laboratory results, and mortality. Multivariate logistic regression was used to predict SREs and mortality risk for pamidronate compared to zoledronic acid. The proportion of patients with renal function deterioration was analyzed using chi(2) tests. RESULTS: The cohort included 118 patients treated with pamidronate and 274 treated with zoledronic acid. Results showed no significant difference in risk of SREs for pamidronate versus zoledronic acid (OR 0.99; 95% CI 0.59 to 1.67; p = 0.98). No significant difference was found in renal function deterioration (chi(2) 2.08; p = 0.15) or mortality (OR 0.71; 95% CI 0.43 to 1.17; p = 0.18). CONCLUSIONS: For patients with prostate cancer, the choice between these 2 bisphosphonates must be balanced between the shorter infusion time of zoledronic acid versus its increased costs. We found no evidence for a difference in outcomes; therefore, pamidronate is an effective choice where clinic capacity permits","","","","","","aph.1P152 [pii];10.1345/aph.1P152 [doi]","Pharmacy Outcomes Research Group, Kaiser Permanente, Downey, CA, USA. michele.m.spence@kp.org","PM:20682850","","","",""

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a Phase II individual cohort study of 72 patients with prostate cancer without metastatic bone disease, enrolled between 1999 and 2002. Patients had 9 months flutamide (250 mg, three times daily) and leuprolide (22.5 mg, 3-monthly depot) after which, patients ceased therapy providing that their PSA levels were <4 ng/mL. AST re-commenced when the PSA level exceeded the pretreatment level or was >20 ng/mL. BMD for hip and spine was the primary endpoint; assessed at baseline; completion of initial treatment period; and at 1 and 2 years after initial treatment (POST period). RESULTS: Osteoporosis increased from 7% at baseline to 10% at 3 years. The BMD declined after 9 months treatment, at -1.9% and -3.3% at hip and spine, respectively (P < 0.001). Subsequent BMD decline in the POST period was attenuated; at 1 years and 2 years later, hip -0.6% (not significant), and -0.8% (P < 0.014), and spine +1.0% and +0.2% (not significant). The BMD change in those remaining 'off' therapy for 2 years (n = 20) was strongly associated with the level of testosterone recovery; a peak testosterone level of <5 nmol/L associated with a greater then normal physiological loss. Testosterone recovery was less likely in older men. CONCLUSION: The attenuation of spine and hip BMD decline after 3-year IAST compared with those reported for continuous AST appears to be due to testosterone driven BMD recovery in the POST period. Failure of testosterone recovery was associated with worse final BMD.

Mitoxanthrone and prednisone were mostly administered, while recently, other agents such as docetaxel or paclitaxel have been tested both with and without hormonal treatment. The objective of the present phase II study was to determine the survival and the response rate of patients after the chemotherapy was administered. Sixty-five patients with advanced prostate cancer were included. The inclusion criteria involved histological confirmation of adenocarcinoma and resistance to hormonal therapy. The majority of the patients had stage IVa or IVb disease and a performance status of 0-1 to 2. The treatment involved chemotherapy in combination with a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) or dexamethasone or estramustine. The hormone treatment preceded the cytotoxic administration and no amelioration in the patients nor prostate serum antigen (PSA) reduction was observed. The initial cytotoxic agents administered were docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) in 25 patients, mitoxanthrone 10 mg/m(2) in 15 patients, epirubicin 75 mg/m(2) in 15 patients and paclitaxel 175 mg/m(2) in 10 patients, all repeated every 3 weeks. The response rate was documented by bone scan, CT scan of the abdomen (and occasionally of the chest) and by the PSA serum value. Clinical benefit was also estimated. Thirty-three (50.77%) patients achieved a partial response; stable disease was observed in 24 (36.92%) patients and disease progression in 8 (12.31%). Twenty-two (33.85%) experienced clinical benefit. A significant PSA reduction was seen in 35 (53.85%) patients. The median survival was 18 months and the range 3-84 months. One, 2, 3 and five-year survival was 75.38, 23.07, 12.30 and 4.66%, respectively. Toxicity was well-tolerated. Patients with hormone-resistant advanced prostate cancer do have good prospects for receiving substantial benefit with the addition of chemotherapy, as observed in the present trial","","","","","","","First Oncology Department, Errikos Dunant Hospital, 115 28 Athens, Greece. dr-gps@ath.forthnet.gr","PM:19578775","","","",""

The purpose of this study was to investigate this phenomenon that could erroneously be interpreted as progressive disease in patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and to establish guidelines for interpretation of follow-up computed tomography (CT) examinations in this situation. Twenty-four patients with newly diagnosed SCLC and bone metastases were retrospectively included in this study. The characteristics of bone lesions in CT examinations were correlated with bone scintigraphy and magnetic resonance imaging, if available. In target lesions the CT density quantified in Hounsfield units (HU) was evaluated at baseline and during follow-up. New osteoblastic lesions occurred during follow-up in 17 of 24 patients. OR was proven in 4 patients and considered most likely in 11 patients; mean density increase in target lesions was 153 HU. The study indicates that osteoblastic response as a healing reaction seems to occur in the majority of patients with SCLC and bone metastases and should not be misinterpreted as progressive disease","","","","","","10.1007/s00330-008-1115-6 [doi]","Department of Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology and Neuroradiology, West German Cancer Center, University Hospital of the University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany. joerg.stattaus@uni-due.de","PM:18677488","","","",""

The prognostic value of tissue prostate-specific antigen (T-PSA) from fine-needle aspiration biopsies was compared with serum total and free prostate-specific antigen, the ratio of free:total serum prostate-specific antigen, tumor stage, cytological grade, and DNA ploidy in 179 patients with stage T2-T4 prostate cancer (CAP). The patients, who were free from bone metastases at the time of diagnosis, were treated by either orchidectomy or medical castration with GnRH analogues or high-dose parenteral depot estrogens. They were followed for at least for 71 months or until death, and the different variables were correlated to time to progression and time to death from CAP. Using Cox univariate analysis, T-PSA was shown to be the most important factor in predicting time to progression and time to death. When the patients were divided into three groups with respect to T-PSA, 56 of 60 (93%) of the patients with low T-PSA levels developed progressive disease, and 52 of 60 (87%) died of CAP. For patients with intermediate T-PSA levels, the corresponding figures were 9 of 60 (15%) and 6 of 60 (10%). None of the 59 patients with high T-PSA values developed progressive disease. Similar but less pronounced relationships were found between tumor progress and CAP-specific death on the one hand and clinical stage, cytological grade, and DNA ploidy on the other. In a Cox multivariate stepwise analysis, T-PSA was the only important factor for time to progression and death. This was also true for the subgroup of patients with stages T2 and T3 disease only. The study shows that T-PSA is superior to other hitherto routinely used markers for the prediction of outcome of hormone-treated patients with newly diagnosed CAP","","","","","","","Department of Urology, Karolinska Institutet, Huddinge University Hospital, Sweden","PM:10656445","","","",""

A rapid prostate-specific antigen (PSA) doubling time or high-grade disease are risk factors for progression to bone metastases and cancer-specific mortality. Salvage external-beam radiotherapy (EBRT) to the prostate fossa is the only curative therapy for patients with biochemical recurrence after RRP, but it is used relatively infrequently to treat recurrent prostate cancer because of a widespread perception that most patients have systemic recurrence, and its reported lack of efficacy for high-risk disease. However, in a large, multicenter study of patients who received salvage EBRT for a rising PSA level after RRP, a substantial proportion of patients with high-grade disease and/or a rapid PSA doubling time were observed to have a favorable outcome after salvage EBRT if it was administered at low PSA values. This suggests that salvage EBRT could provide long -term cancer control for patients at the highest risk of progression to bone metastases and cancer-specific mortality. A nomogram that predicts the 3-year progression-free probability after salvage EBRT has been developed to facilitate the selection of patients for this potentially curative therapy. In the absence of other curative therapies, all patients with recurrent prostate cancer should be considered for salvage EBRT, particularly those with positive surgical margins. To be successful, salvage EBRT should be administered at the earliest evidence of recurrent disease, once a rising PSA trend as been confirmed","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Baseline measurements of height, weight and blood pressure were available in 336,159 men in the Swedish Construction Workers cohort. During an average of 22.2 years of follow-up, 10,002 incident cases and 2,601 fatal cases of prostate cancer were identified in National registers. For 5,219 cases, tumor characteristics were available; 2,817 tumors were classified as nonaggressive and 2,402 as aggressive. Relative risks of disease were estimated from Cox regression models, using attained age as time-scale, and adjusting for birth year, smoking status and body mass index (BMI). Top compared to bottom quintile level of systolic or diastolic blood pressure was associated with a significant 15-20% decreased risk of incident prostate cancer (p for trend: systolic < 0.0001, diastolic = 0.3), but blood pressure was not significantly associated with risk of fatal prostate cancer. BMI was not associated with prostate cancer incidence, but was positively associated with fatal prostate cancer; men in the top quintile had a 30% increased risk (p for trend = 0.0004). The associations between blood pressure and BMI and nonaggressive tumors were similar to those of incident prostate cancer, and associations with aggressive tumors were similar to those of fatal prostate cancer. Data from our study suggest that hypertension is associated with a decreased risk of incident prostate cancer, but the explanation for this finding is unclear. Our study support a positive association between overweight and risk of fatal prostate cancer. (c) 2010 UICC","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Promising new treatments specifically target metastatic disease in the bone, the predominant site of spread in prostate cancer. Recent advances in the understanding of the biology of the tumor-bone microenvironment are leading to the development of new bone-targeted therapies. In this article, we review current and developing clinical strategies designed to control prostate-cancer bone metastases. RECENT FINDINGS: Newly developed biologic therapies that target prostate-cancer bone metastases have shown promising results in animal models and clinical trials. Additionally, currently established drugs such as bisphosphonates and bone-seeking radiopharmaceuticals are being applied in novel ways in an effort to improve patient care. SUMMARY: Therapies targeting bone in advanced prostate cancer have demonstrated improvements in morbidity, and more recently, in overall survival.

The results were compared with those of patients who received 89Sr-chloride or zoledronic acid separately. METHODS: 25 patients (12 women; mean age 65+/-13 years) chronically treated with zoledronic acid underwent bone pain palliation with 150 MBq of 89Sr-chloride at least 6 months later that bisphoshonate therapy started (group A). 13 patients (6 women; mean age 70+/-12 years) received 89Sr-chloride alone (group B) and 11 patients (5 women; mean age 69+/-12 years) were chronically treated and continued to receive only zoledronic acid therapy (group C), both constituted the control groups. Patients kept a daily pain diary assessing both their discomfort and the pain of specific sites by using a visual analog scale (VAS), rating from 0 (no d iscomfort-no pain) to 10 (worst discomfort-pain). These diaries were reviewed weekly for 2 months and three different physicians rated the pain response on a scale of -2 (considerable deterioration) to +2 (considerable improvement). RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were similar in the three groups. The reduction of total discomfort and of bone pain in the group A was significantly greater as compared to group B (P<0.01) and group C (P<0.01). During the monitored period, a significant improvement of clinical conditions was observed in the group A, varying the rate from -1 to 1 as compared to both groups B and C in which the rate changed from -1 to 0. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that combined therapy of 89Sr-chloride and zoledronic acid in patients with painful bone metastases is more effective in treating pain and improving clinical conditions than 89Sr-chloride or zoledronic acid used separately","","","","","","S8756-3282(05)00535-1 [pii];10.1016/j.bone.2005.12.004 [doi]","Institute of Biostructures and Bioimages, National Council of Research, Naples, Italy. giosto24@hotmail.com","PM:16434248","","","",""

Patients and methods: In this pilot study, 40 men were randomized 1:1 to bicalutamide 50mg o.d. or cyproterone acetate 100mg t.i.d. 5 days prior to goserelin acetate and continued for 21 days thereafter. PSA, luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and testosterone were obtained before treatment and on days 6, 8, 10, 16, 21 and 28. Primary end point was PSA. Hormone profile and clinical features including urinary symptoms and bone pain were secondary end points. Results: Both groups were equally matched apart from serum creatinine and ALP. The speed and magnitude of the percentage change in median PSA from baseline was increased for the CPA group but there was no statistically significant difference in the two groups. Although those receiving bicalutamide all showed a testosterone peak, this remained within the normal range. No difference in the frequency of drug-specific adverse events was found. None of the patients died or developed cord compression during the study period. Conclusion: Bicalutamide is able to suppress the initial PSA surge as effectively as cyproterone acetate albeit slightly delayed. A statement whether bicalutamide is equally good at preventing clinical flare cannot be made and should be assessed in an appropriately powered study.

METHODS: Baseline and 12-week HRQL was collected using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC QLQ-C30) and the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Prostate (FACT-P). Outcomes included: (1) survival; (2) time to disease progression and (3) time to bone pain. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used. The relative predictive performance of each HRQL instrument and domain was compared. RESULTS: Baseline HRQL scores and 12-week change scores > the median were significant predictors of all clinical outcomes but varied by domain. For example, the hazard of death for a change in FACT-P Grand Total Score > median was 49% of the hazard for a change < or = the median. Including baseline or 12-week change in HRQL resulted in improvement in prediction performance. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with better baseline HRQL have better predicted survival, time to disease progression and pain prognosis than those with worse HRQL. In addition, the 12-week change in HRQL appears to improve predictive accuracy for most clinical outcomes. It appears that greater deterioration in HRQL is prognostic for rapid disease progression","","","","","","10.1007/s11136-006-0003-2 [doi]","Pharmaceutical Outcomes Research Program, University of Colorado School of Pharmacy, Denver, CO 80262, USA.

This first-in-human study of [18F]FMAU was conducted as a pilot in patients to determine its biodistribution and suitability for imaging DNA synthesis in tumors using positron emission tomography (PET). METHODS: Fourteen patients with diverse cancers (brain, prostate, colorectal, lung, and breast) were imaged with [18F]FMAU. We obtained dynamic PET images for 60 min and a whole-body image. Blood and urine samples were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography to measure metabolites and clearance. RESULTS: Active tumors in the breast, brain, lung and prostate were clearly visualized with standardized uptake values (SUVs) of 2.19, 1.28, 2.21, and 2.27-4.42, respectively. Unlike with other tracers of proliferation, low uptake of [18F]FMAU was seen in the normal bone marrow (SUV(mean) 0.7), allowing visualization of metastatic prostate cancer (SUV 3.07). Low background was also observed in the brain, pelvis, and thorax, aside from heart uptake (SUV 3.36-8.78). In the abdomen, increased physiological uptake was seen in the liver (SUV 10.07-20.88) and kidneys (SUV 7.18-15.66) due to metabolism and/or excretion, but the urinary bladder was barely visible (SUV(mean) 2.03). On average, 95% of the activity in the blood was cleared within 10 min post injection and an average of 70% of the activity in the urine was intact FMAU at 60 min post injection. CONCLUSION: Tumors in the brain, prostate, thorax, and bone can be clearly visualized with FMAU. In the upper abdomen, visualization is limited by the physiological uptake by the liver and kidneys","","","","","","10.1007/s00259-004-1713-8 [doi]","Karmanos Cancer Institute, Departments of Medicine, Radiology and Pediatrics, Wayne State University, 4100 John R Street, 4 HWCRC, Detroit, MI, 48201-2013, USA","PM:15586282","","","",""

It is estimated that the lifetime risk of western men having prostate cancer is about 30%, with the risk of dying from the cancer being 3%. Increasing age is the strongest pre-determinant for the development of prostate cancer. Virtually all cancers are adenocarcinomas with the grade being indicated by the Gleason score. Often, there are no presenting symptoms. Investigations such as, the serum prostate-specific antigen level, digital rectal examination and biopsies via a trans-rectal ultrasound probe, are required for diagnosis. Staging, if required, consists of MRI/CT for locally advanced disease and/or a bone scan for detection of bony metatstases. Management depends largely on the stag e of the disease. For localised prostate cancer, radical prostatectomy can offer a cure. Side effects include erectile dysfunction and incontinence. Prostate cancer is also radio-sensitive and can be given as external beam radiotherapy or in the form of brachytherapy. Hormonal therapy, such LHRH analogues and anti-androgens are used in locally advanced and metastatic disease. Hormones do not cure, but slow the progression of the cancer. Follow-up consist of PSA surveillance and other therapeutic options can be considered if the PSA starts to rise. Cytotoxic chemotherapy is increasingly being used for hormone escaped prostate cancer. The survival rate at ten years may be as high as 90% for a well-differentiated, localized prostate cancer. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 136 consecutive patients with prostate cancer underwent primary radiotherapy. All but 4 patients received 6000 cGy to the prostate. The minimal follow-up was 22.9 years. RESULTS: Of the 136 patients, 93 had Stage B (T2), 9 Stage A (T1), and 34 Stage C (T3). Sixty-nine percent of the patients developed recurrence, and 51% of all patients died of prostate cancer. The recurrences developed at a steady state throughout the length of follow-up. One half the recurrences occurred after 10 years, and recurrence was still observed >20 years after treatment. The survival rate at 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 years was 81%, 59%, 37%, 16%, and 10%, respectively. The recurrence-free survival rate at 25 years was 17%. The median survival for Grade 3-4 patients was 6.3 years and for Grade 1-2 patients was 13.0 years. The median survival for those with T1 tumors was 12.9 years; T2 tumors, 12.4 years; and T3 tumors, 9.5 years. CONCLUSION: Despite favorable early results, with long-term follow-up, patients continued to experience prostate cancer recurrence. Unless they died an intercurrent death, they were highly likely to develop recurrence and die of prostate cancer. The conclusions from treatment studies with <15 years of follow-up should be viewed as preliminary","","","","","","10.1016/j.ijrobp.2003.10.026 [doi];S0360301603022375 [pii]","Department of Radiation Oncology, Cancer Care Northwest, Spokane, WA 99204, USA.

After 8 weeks of therapy the combination was given every other week. RESULTS: From February 1998 to February 1999, 23 men were enrolled with a median age of 69 years (range 50-83 years). The median prostate-specific antigen (PSA) at entry was 160 ng/ml (range 0-802 ng/ml). A median of 13 weeks of therapy was administered and the median follow-up was 14.8 months. Eleven patients (48%) had lower extremity edema requiring diuretic therapy, two (9%) had grade 2 granulocytopenia and four patients [17%; 95% confidence interval (CI) 5% to 39%] had a thromboembolic episode. There was no treatment-related mortality. Fifteen of 21 patients (71%; 95% CI 49% to 89%) had at least a 50% decrease in the PSA for at least 2 months with a median time to serologic progression of 3.5 months (range 0.75-10.5 months).

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We administered 4 mg of ibandronate as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes. Thirty patients (16 breast cancers, 4 prostate cancers, 10 multiple myelomas) with bone metastases received 4 mg of ibandronate injected intravenously over 30 minutes in normal saline 0.9%, 250cc every 3 or 4 weeks. The patients were followed-up over 2 hours after infusion. A total of 198 infusions were administered over a period of 24 months and the patients were followed-up for long-term ibandronate-related side-effects, as well as for any potential clinical benefit. RESULTS: Following the first administration of ibantronate, serum levels of calcium, phosphate and alkaline phosphatase were significantly decreased and the difference was statistically significant (p < 0.001) for all three parameters examined. The reduced time of infusion (30 minutes vs 2 hours) did not correlate with any side-effects during or post-administration. Serum levels of creatinine and urea nitrogen did not increase significantly, while changes in temperature and blood pressure were not detected in the patients examined. With regard to efficacy, all the patients, after repeated administrations, reduced the doses of analgesics needed; 26 out of 30 patients had stable disease in the bones while 1 out of 30 patients had significant improvement of bone lesions in consecutive bone scans. CONCLUSION: Infusional administration of ibandronate is efficient in the management of hypercalcaemia of malignancy and it results in a reduced need for analgesics. The rapid infusion over 30 minutes is safe and could be given in the setting of a day care unit","","","","","","","Oncology/Haematology Unit, 3rd Department of Medicine, Sotiria General Hospital, Athens Medical School, Athens, Greece. knsyrigos@usa.net","PM:12494878","","","",""

However, there are concerns about the higher re-treatment rates and the efficacy of preventing future complications such as pathological fracture and spinal cord compression by single fraction radiotherapy. OBJECTIVES: To undertake a systematic review and meta-analysis of single fraction radiotherapy versus multifraction radiotherapy for metastatic bone pain relief and prevention of bone complications. SEARCH STRATEGY: Trials were identified through MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cancerlit, reference lists of relevant articles and conference proceedings. Relevant data was extracted. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised studies comparing single fraction radiotherapy with multifraction radiotherapy on metastatic bone pain DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The analyses were performed using intention-to-treat principle. The results were pooled using meta-analysis to estimate the effect of treatment on pain response, re-treatment rate, pathological fracture rate and spinal cord compression rate. MAIN RESULTS: Eleven trials that involved 3435 patients were identified. Of 3435 patients, 52 patients were randomised more than once for different painful bone metastasis sites. Altogether, 3487 painful sites were randomised. The trials included patients with painful bone metastases of any primary sites, but were mainly prostate, breast and lung. The overall pain response rates for single fraction radiotherapy and multifraction radiotherapy were 60% (1059/1779) and 59% (1038/1769) respectively, giving an odds ratio of 1.03 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.89 - 1.19) indicating no difference between the two radiotherapy schedules. There was also no difference in complete pain response rates for single fraction radiotherapy (34% [497/1441]) and multifraction radiotherapy (32% [463/1435]) with an odds ratio of 1.11 (95%CI 0.94-1.30). Patients treated by single fraction radiotherapy had a higher re-treatment rate with 21.5% (267/1240) requiring re-treatment compared to 7.4% (91/1236) of patients in the multifraction radiotherapy arm (odds ratio 3.44 [95%CI 2.67-4.43]). The pathological fracture rate was also higher in single fraction radiotherapy arm patients. Three percent (37/1240) of patients treated by single fraction radiotherapy developed pathological fracture compared to 1.6% (20/1236) for those treated by multifraction radiotherapy (odds ratio 1.82 [95%CI 1.06-3.11]). The spinal cord compression rates were similar for both arms (odds ratio 1.41 [95%CI 0.72-2.75]). Repeated analyses excluding dropout patients gave similar results. REVIEWERS' CONCLUSIONS: Single fraction radiotherapy was as effective as multifraction radiotherapy in relieving metastatic bone pain.

However, there are concerns about the higher retreatment rates and the efficacy of preventing future complications such as pathological fracture and spinal cord compression by single fraction radiotherapy. OBJECTIVES: To undertake a systematic review and meta-analysis of single fraction radiotherapy versus multifraction radiotherapy for metastatic bone pain relief and prevention of bone complications. SEARCH STRATEGY: Trials were identified through MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cancerlit, reference lists of relevant articles and conference proceedings. Relevant data was extracted. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised studies comparing single fraction radiotherapy with multifraction radiotherapy on metastatic bone pain DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The analyses were performed using intention-to-treat principle. The results were pooled using meta-analysis to estimate the effect of treatment on pain response, re-treatment rate, pathological fracture rate and spinal cord compression rate. MAIN RESULTS: Eleven trials that involved 3435 patients were identified. Of 3435 patients, 52 patients were randomised more than once for different painful bone metastasis sites. Altogether, 3487 painful sites were randomised. The trials included patients with painful bone metastases of any primary sites, but were mainly prostate, breast and lung. The overall pain response rates for single fraction radiotherapy and multifraction radiotherapy were 60% (1059/1779) and 59% (1038/1769) respectively, giving an odds ratio of 1.03 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.89 to 1.19) indicating no difference between the two radiotherapy schedules. There was also no difference in complete pain response rates for single fraction radiotherapy (34% [497/1441]) and multifraction radiotherapy (32% [463/1435]) with an odds ratio of 1.11 (95% CI 0.94 to 1.30). Patients treated by single fraction radiotherapy had a higher re-treatment rate with 21.5% (267/1240) requiring re-treatment compared to 7.4% (91/1236) of patients in the multifraction radiotherapy arm (odds ratio 3.44 [95% CI 2.67 to 4.43]). The pathological fracture rate was also higher in single fraction radiotherapy arm patients. Three percent (37/1240) of patients treated by single fraction radiotherapy developed pathological fracture compared to 1.6% (20/1236) for those treated by multifraction radiotherapy (odds ratio 1.82 [95% CI 1.06 to 3.11]). The spinal cord compression rates were similar for both arms (odds ratio 1.41 [95% CI 0.72 to 2.75]). Repeated analyses excluding dropout patients gave similar results. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Single fraction radiotherapy was as effective as multifraction radiotherapy in relieving metastatic bone pain. However, the retreatment rate and pathological fracture rates were higher after single fraction radiotherapy. Studies with quality of life and health economic end points are warranted to find out the optimal treatment option. EASING OF BONE PAIN CAUSED BY METASTATIC CANCER: SINGLE VERSUS MULTIFRACTION RADIOTHERAPY: The spread of tumour to the bone (metastasis) is a common characteristic of many malignancies including cancers of the prostate, breast and lung. This may be associated with pain, compression of the spinal cord and the potential for bone fracture. Radiotherapy is used to treat bone metastases, however, the optimum treatment schedule is unclear. This review compares whether a single fraction of radiotherapy is better than multifractions of radiotherapy for alleviating the symptoms associated with tumours that have spread to the bone. Eleven randomised trials were identified in the published literature that compared single versus multifraction radiotherapy for bone metastases. Pooled analysis of these trials suggested that single fraction radiotherapy was as effective as multifraction radiotherapy in controlling bone pain. However, there were more bone fractures in patients treated by single fraction radiotherapy, and they received further treatment sessions more often than those receiving multifraction radiotherapy","","","","","","","","","","","",""

and adverse skeletal events. The purpose of this review is to identify mechanisms of treatment-induced bone loss and adverse skeletal events in this population. Furthermore, this review emphasizes the importance of screening for baseline risk factors for adverse skeletal events. Once these risk factors are identified, early evaluation and treatment of bone health is warranted. This article reviews an approach to the management of bone health in breast and prostate cancer survivors, including a discussion regarding lifestyle interventions, calcium and vitamin D supplementation, as well as the indications for initiation of bisphosphonate therapy. This article also reviews potential new agents, such as cathepsin K inhibitors and RANKL inhibitors, for the reduction of bone loss in high-risk populations.

Chemotherapy as a first-line option leaves room for improvement, while second-line options are multiple and somewhat controversial. Methods: Clinically relevant articles focusing on chemotherapy drugs for metastatic prostate cancer and their mechanism of action and efficacy were reviewed from January 2004 through April 2006. Results: Docetaxel is the standard of care for AIPC. However, for doublets with docetaxel or second-line chemotherapy, multiple studies have shown interesting and promising results with calcitriol, thalidomide, bevacizumab, satraplatin, vaccines, ixabepilone, and atrasentan. Conclusions: Docetaxel should be considered for first-line treatment of metastatic AIPC. Due to its progression-free survival of only 6 months, more effective drugs and drug combinations need to be developed to treat patients with AIPC. Combination treatments with docetaxel and other new agents are promising, but adequately powered phase III trials need to be conducted with survival as the principal endpoint for these promising drug combinations","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There were 1286 eligible patients randomized to this study. Of these, 794 have been followed for > or = 10.5 years and are included in the analyses. Proportional odds models were used to predict 3 survival categories (survival for < 5 years, 5 up to 10 years, and > or = 10 years). Baseline patient and disease characteristics investigated were protocol treatment (flutamide vs. placebo), severity of disease, SWOG performance status (PS), bone pain, Gleason score, race, age, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level at study entry. Of the 794 evaluable patients, 77% lived < 5 years, 16% lived 5 up to 10 years, and 7% lived > or = 10 years. Factors predicting a statistical significant association with longer survival (P < 0.05) included minimal disease, better PS, no bone pain, lower Gleason score, and lower PSA level. All but PS were also significant in multivariate analyses. However, only 13% of patients (5 of 38) who lived > or = 10 years were correctly predicted in their survival category based on the model, whereas 98% (405 of 414) who died within the first 5 years were correctly predicted.

The current study identified physician practices in preventing or treating osteoporosis during ADT. The practices of interest are the uses of dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans, bisphosphonates, calcium or vitamin D supplement, calcitonin, or estrogen. METHODS: A retrospective medical record review was conducted. Patients were included if they had received ADT with goserelin injection for >/= 1 year. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify independent predictors of receiving at least one intervention. RESULTS: Analyses included 184 patients. Most were the elderly with multiple risk factors for osteoporosis. Only 8.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.6-13.0%) of patients received a DXA scan at least once during the past 3 years. Oral and intravenous bisphosphonates were prescribed in 4.9% (95%CI, 1.8-8.0%) and 0.5% (95%CI, 0-2.0%) of patients, respectively, during the past year. Overall, 14.7% of patients (95%CI, 9.5-20.0%) received at least one intervention. Concurrent risk factors for osteoporosis, including smoking, alcoholism, advanced age, low body mass index, long duration of ADT, multiple comorbidities, history of fractures, and steroid use, were not independent predictors of having received interventions. However, bone metastasis was, with a hazard ratio of 5.6 (95%CI, 1.99-15.6%). Primary care physicians provided the greatest number of interventions and cancer-related specialists provided the fewest. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients with prostate carcinoma undergoing ADT did not receive interventions to prevent or treat osteoporosis. Having other concurrent risk factors for osteoporosis was not predictive of receiving these few interventions","","","","","","10.1002/cncr.20766 [doi]","Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Loyola University Chicago Stritch School of Medicine, Maywood, Illinois 60153, USA. ttanve@lumc.edu","PM:15597384","","","",""

This study was also performed on 24 Stage C-D1 prostate cancer patients left without therapy through their own choice and in 20 controls with benign prostatic hypertrophy. In all these subjects serum PSA, %FPSA and CgA concentrations were measured at three-month intervals and bone scans were performed 1-2 times during the overall monitoring period. After nine months of monitoring, no differences in CgA-positivity between two prostate cancer patient groups had been observed. However, during the last six months of monitoring, the acquired CgA-positivity was statistically significant in treated patients when compared to the untreated group (p<<0.001). Bone metastases were found in 38% of CgA-positive prostate cancer patients (regardless of the therapy status) and in only 6% of studied patients with a steady normal serum CgA concentration. According to the data reported herein we advocate the assessment of serum CgA concentrations at 3-month intervals during hormonal manipulation. The reported results may reawaken the idea of intermittent hormone therapy and, in particular, the replacement of Mab after 9 months by Casodex (Flutamide) monotherapy for a 6-month period","","","","","","","University Hospital Sestre Milosrdnice, Zagreb, Croatia. marko_tarle@yahoo.com","PM:12174956","","","",""

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-two patients with bone metastases (15 males and 27 females; mean age, 72 years; range, 48-86), confined to home because of functional impairment or low performance status, were enrolled into the trial. They were included in a comprehensive program of home care, and were treated with zoledronic acid, 4 mg. Primary end point of this observational trial was the safety assessment of the treatment at home; secondary end points were the clinical assessment of the time to treatment discontinuation and the definition of a pattern of patients who could benefit by a home treatment with intravenous bisphosphonates. RESULTS: Nineteen patients had breast cancer; 7, multiple myeloma; 5, non-small-cell lung cancer; 4, renal cancer; 4, prostate cancer; 1, thyroid cancer; 1 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; and 1 soft tissue sarcoma. On the whole, 220 home treatments were administered in 3 years, with a median of 4 administrations per patient (range, 1-28). Median time to treatment discontinuation was 130 days. The treatment was interrupted for worsening of the performance status in 30 patients (71.4%), length of the treatment greater than 24 months in 2 patients (4.8%), hypocalcemia in 1 patient (2.4%), renal failure in 1 patient (2.4%). No difference in median time to treatment discontinuation was observed among patients with breast cancer, multiple myeloma, or other tumors in univariate analysis. Multivariate analysis showed no prognostic significance for kind of tumor, age at the time of entering the trial, gender, and number of extraosseous sites of disease. No acute major side effects were observed during the treatment, and the treatment had to be interrupted for side effects in 2 patients (4.8%).

Fourteen men over 65 yr of age and receiving established LHRH-A treatment (EST group) without bony metastases and 12 men who received LHRH-A as neoadjuvant therapy for locally advanced prostate cancer (NEO group) were randomized (double blind) to receive either 1 mg/d micronized E(2) (n = 12) or placebo (PL; n = 13) for 9 wk. E(2), estrone, testosterone, SHBG, PTH, and 25-hydroxy- and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels as well as markers of bone resorption [N- and C-telopeptide cross-links (NTX and CTX) and deoxypyridinoline] and bone formation (bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, and N-terminal type I collagen) were measured before LHRH-A in the NEO group, before [baseline (BL)] and after 9 wk of E(2) or PL in all patients, and 6 wk after E(2) treatment in the EST group. In the NEO group, hormone levels fell 3 wk after the initial LHRH-A injection, and deoxypyridinoline increased significantly (P = 0.006). At BL, the EST group had higher bone turnover due to the longer duration of LHRH-A treatment. With E(2) treatment, E(2) levels rose into the normal male range, and two resorption markers decreased significantly from BL by 33% for NTX (P < 0.001) and 28% for CTX (P = 0.009). Bone formation markers did not change. PTH increased by 43% from BL (P < 0.01) in the E(2) group and decreased 16% from BL in the PL group (P < 0.01). Ionized calcium did not change in the E(2) group, but increased in the PL group by 2.3% (P < 0.01). NTX and CTX increased 6 wk after E(2) withdrawal in the EST group. We conclude that E(2) inhibits bone resorption in hypogonadal men through a direct skeletal effect that is independent of PTH. Low dose estrogen may be an option for the prevention and/or treatment of bone loss in this population","","","","","","","Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism, University of Connecticut Health Center, 263 Farmington Avenue, Farmington, CT 06030-1317, USA. taxel@nso.uchc.edu","PM:12414849","","","",""

In contrast, the effect of endogenous sex hormones, specifically estrogen, on cardiovascular disease, inflammation and clotting parameters in men has not been well-studied. Men receiving androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer provide a unique model to study the effect of estrogen alone on inflammation and clotting factors. In a short-term randomized controlled trial of 17-beta estradiol (E(2)) versus placebo, we measured sex hormones, markers of inflammation including homocysteine (HC), C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and coagulation factors including fibrinogen, plasminogen activator-inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and anti-thrombin-III (AT-III) in 27 older men without bone metastases receiving androgen deprivation therapy or neoadjuvant treatment for prostate cancer. After 9 weeks of E(2) treatment, there was no difference in inflammation or clotting parameters between groups, but after 9 weeks of treatment AT-III increased in the E(2) treated group and decreased in the placebo group. CRP, homocysteine and IL-6 did not show any significant differences. We also evaluated the above parameters in 12 men 3 weeks after acute steroid withdrawal with androgen deprivation therapy and found no significant changes. We found an increase in AT-III in men receiving E(2) which may be related to gonadal steroid withdrawal, but no significant differences in other inflammatory or clotting factor parameters.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A 6-month randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted, including 40 men aged >/= 55 years receiving LHRH-agonist treatment for 6 months for locally advanced prostate cancer. Bone mineral density (BMD) of the lumbar spine, femoral neck, and total hip was measured every 6 months. In addition, bone turnover markers including N-telopeptide, serum C-telopeptide and procollagen peptide, and 25-OH vitamin D and intact parathyroid hormone were measured at baseline and at 6 months. RESULTS: After 6 months of LHRH-agonist therapy, the control group had a significant decline at the spine and hip BMD sites; however, the risedronate group had no bone loss at the hip and an increase at the lumber spine. Markers of bone turnover were increased significantly in the control group but unchanged in the risedronate group.

Although ADT is effective at suppressing prostate-specific antigen (PSA), stabilizing disease, alleviating symptoms in advanced disease, and potentially prolonging survival, it is not without serious side effects. However, to the authors' knowledge, there is lack of a systematic review of its major adverse effects to date. The authors of this report systematically reviewed and quantitatively assessed the literature on skeletal and cardiac side effects associated with ADT in men with prostate cancer. The PubMed database was searched for relevant published articles from 1966 to May 2008, and 683 articles were reviewed systematically from an original 20 different Medical Subject Heading search combinations. The focus of the review was on bone-related and cardiovascular-related outcomes. When appropriate, results were pooled from articles on specific adverse outcomes, summary risk estimates were calculated, and tests of heterogeneity were performed. Fourteen articles were identified that met inclusion criteria from the original 683 studies. Men who underwent ADT for prostate cancer had a significantly increased risk of overall fracture of 23% (summary relative risk, 1.23; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.10-1.38) compared with men who had prostate cancer but who did not undergo ADT. Furthermore, men who underwent ADT had a 17% increase in cardiovascular-related mortality compared with men who did not undergo with ADT (summary hazards ratio, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.07-1.29). Significant elevations in the risk of diabetes also were observed from 2 large studies. ADT was associated with an increased risk of skeletal fracture, incident diabetes, and cardiovascular-related mortality, although the absolute risk of these events was low. Preventive measures against these adverse effects and careful assessment of patient's baseline health status should be considered","","","","","","10.1002/cncr.24283 [doi]","Division of Epidemiology and Disease Control, School of Public Health, University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, Texas 77030, USA. lockwood.g.taylor@uth.tmc.edu","PM:19399748","","","",""

Investigators continue to explore the use of hormone therapy, particularly luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) analogues, earlier in the course of disease. OBJECTIVE: This review summarizes clinical evidence regarding the safety and efficacy of LHRH analogues in the treatment of locoregional disease or following biochemical failure. METHODS: Relevant information from clinical studies was identified through a MEDLINE search of the medical literature published in English in the last 5 years (search terms: LHRH and prostate cancer). The search included prospective and retrospective clinical studies on LHRH therapy in locally advanced prostate cancer. Additional relevant publications published before 1999 were identified from citations in the resulting articles. RESULTS: The available clinical evidence suggests that the use of LHRH analogues as adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy in conjunction with radiation therapy may improve survival outcomes. Few studies have evaluated the use of LHRH analogues after biochemical failure. However, several related studies indicate that initiating hormone therapy earlier rather than later may provide some clinical benefit. When considering early initiation of LHRH therapy, the potential risks of long-term treatment must be considered. Physiologic changes, such as deterioration of body composition and bone quality, may have important effects on the risk of developing cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis. CONCLUSIONS: Although some clinical evidence supports the use of LHRH analogues as adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy or following biochemical failure, further study is needed. In the meantime, clinicians should carefully weigh the potential benefits and risks of early hormone therapy when making treatment decisions","","","","","","S0149-2918(05)00035-4 [pii];10.1016/j.clinthera.2005.02.016 [doi]","Hopital St. Louis, Paris, France. pierre.teillac@sls.ap-hop-paris.fr","PM:15878381","","","",""

Racial differences in prostate cancer have usually been attributed to socioeconomic status, quality of care, comorbidities, and dietary factors. In a clinical trial population, some of these factors, such as access to care and performance status, are likely to be relatively uniform. METHODS: The patients included in the review had been registered in clinical trials between 1991 and 2001 at Wayne State University. RESULTS: Of 145 patients, 90 (62%) were white Americans and 55 (38%) were black Americans, 27% were 70 years or older, and 34% had minimal metastatic disease (axial bony involvement and/or lymph node involvement) and 66% had extensive disease (appendicular skeleton and/or visceral involvement). The chi-square test demonstrated no statistically significant difference by race in the distribution of the patient and disease characteristics. The prostate-specific antigen response rate was 41% in whites and 29% in blacks (P = 0.12). Log-rank analysis revealed race to be the only statistically significant factor predictive of the time to prostate-specific antigen progression (P = 0.02, median 4.6 months in whites and 2.3 months in blacks). No statistically significant difference by race was found in overall survival. Poor performance status, extensive disease, elevated alkaline phosphatase and lactate dehydrogenase levels, and a lack of prostate-specific antigen response were statistically significant predictors of worse overall survival. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with androgen-independent metastatic prostate cancer studied in clinical trials, race was an independent predictor of therapeutic outcome.

Zoledronic acid has been evaluated in randomized, double-blind clinical trials of osteoporosis, Paget's disease of bone, and metastatic, osteolytic and osteoblastic bone disease. Antiosteoclast activity has been demonstrated by reductions in the bone breakdown products N-telopeptide, C-telopeptide and deoxypyridinoline. Bone mineral density, measured by dual energy x-ray absorptometry, is increased with administration of zoledronic acid in postmenopausal osteoporosis.

Therefore, management of long-term bone health is emerging as an important aspect of comprehensive cancer care. Patients with cancer typically have a number of additional risk factors for osteoporosis that should prompt screening, regardless of patient age or sex. Maintaining bone health requires a broad knowledge base, including understanding underlying bone metabolism and how it is affected by both cancer itself and the drugs used to treat cancer, the effect of chemotherapy-induced menopause on bone health, bone markers and imaging techniques used to assess bone health, therapeutic strategies to maintain bone health, and treatment of bone metastases, including surgery for pathologic fractures. Multiple members of the healthcare team may need to be involved in education and care of the patient.

Newer approaches such as ultrasmall superparamagnetic particles of iron oxide (USPIO) and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) have inconsistent diagnostic accuracy and are difficult to interpret. Objective: To assess whether combined USPIO and DW-MRI (USPIO-DW-MRI) improves staging of normal-sized lymph nodes in bladder and/or pr ostate cancer patients. Design, setting, and participants: Twenty-one consecutive patients with bladder and/or prostate cancer were enrolled between May and October 2008. One patient was excluded secondary to bone metastases detected on DW-MRI with subsequent abstention from surgery. Intervention: Patients preoperatively underwent 3-T MRI before and after administration of lymphotropic USPIO using conventional MRI sequences combined with DW-MRI. Surgery consisted of extended pelvic lymphadenectomy and resection of primary tumors. Measurements: Diagnostic accuracies of the new combined USPIO-DW-MRI approach compared with the 'classic' reading method evaluating USPIO i mages without and with DW-MRI versus histopathology were evaluated. Duration of the two reading methods was noted for each patient. Results and limitations: Diagnostic accuracy (90% per patient or per pelvic side) was comparable for the classic and the USPIO-DW-MRI reading method, while time of analysis with 80 min (range 45-180 min) for the classic and 13 min (range 5-90 min) for the USPIO-DW-MRI method was significantly shorter (p < 0.0001). Interobserver agreement (three blinded readers) was high with a kappa value of 0.75 and 0.84, respectively. Histopathological analysis showed metastases in 26 of 802 analyzed lymph nodes (3.2%). Of these, 24 nodes (92%) were correctly diagnosed as positive on USPIO-DW-MRI. In two patients, one micrometastasis each (1.0 x 0.2 mm; 0.7 x 0.4 mm) was missed in all imaging studies. Conclusions: USPIO-DW-MRI is a fast and accurate method for detecting pelvic lymph node metastases, even in normal-sized nodes of bladder or prostate cancer patients.

It is not known whether the poorer survival of African-American men with prostate cancer reflects their later stage at diagnosis or differences in the basic biology of their disease. To evaluate this question, we examined outcomes of African-American and white men with metastatic prostate cancer in the context of a randomized clinical trial. METHODS: Southwest Oncology Group Study 8894 was a randomized phase III trial that compared orchiectomy with or without flutamide in men with metastatic prostate cancer. Using data from 288 African-American and 975 white men in the trial, we conducted a proportional hazards regression analysis to determine if ethnicity was an independent predictor of survival. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: African-American men were more likely than white men to have extensive disease and bone pain and had poorer performance status, younger age at study entry, higher Gleason score, and higher PSA levels. After adjustment for these prognostic variables, the hazard ratio (HR) for all-cause mortality for African-American men relative to white men was 1.23 (P: =.018). Further adjustment for initial quality-of-life assessments also resulted in higher HRs associated with African-American ethnicity relative to white ethnicity (HR = 1.39; P: =.007). CONCLUSIONS: African-American men with metastatic prostate cancer have a statistically significantly worse prognosis than white men that cannot be explained by the prognostic variables explored in this study. These data should give increased impetus for efforts to detect the disease early in African-American men and for the development of more effective therapies based on potential biologic differences in this ethnic group","","","","","","","The University of Texas Health Sciences Center at San Antonio, USA. thompsoni@uthscsa.edu","PM:11158191","","","",""

METHODS: Fifteen patients were treated with zoledronic acid 4 mg intravenously every 28 days and imatinib mesylate 400 mg/day. The pain response, defined as a 2-point reduction in the Present Pain Intensity Scale or normalization if the initial score was 1, was the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints included palliative response, prostate-specific antigen response, measurable disease response, time to progression, impact on quality of life, decrease in markers of bone turnover, and tolerability of the drug combination. RESULTS: The study was stopped early because of a lack of activity. No palliative or clinical activity was detected for the combination, and no prostate-specific antigen responses were observed. The median time to progression was 4 weeks (95% confidence interval 3 to 5), and the median duration of treatment was 8 weeks (range 1.6 to 16.7). The median overall survival was 54 weeks (95% confidence interval 18 to 90). Therapy was associated with a reduction in urine N-telopeptides and a trend toward a reduction in serum osteocalcin, but no change occurred in bone-specific alkaline phosphatase.

Although prostate cancer that is confined to the gland can be cured in many patients using surgery or radiation, these treatments are only effective for localized tumors and the long-term failure rates for these treatments suggests that prostate cancer can metastasize relatively early in the course of the disease. Once prostate cancer has metastasized there are no curative therapies. The greatest challenge in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer is to access and eliminate metastatic cells. Therefore, effective prostate cancer therapy will require novel strategies to target cancer cells both at the site of the primary tumor and at distant metastatic sites. In this article we review several therapeutic targets and approaches that may provide new treatments for metastatic prostate cancer. We discuss the use of small molecules to target specific molecular events associated with metastatic prostate cancer, the use of specific antibodies that target unique metastasis associated molecules and the use of various gene therapy strategies to achieve anti-metastatic activities","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we assessed the value of MRI of the axial skeleton (AS-MRI) as a single step technique to quantify bone metastases and measure tumor response. METHODS: AS-MRI was performed in 38 patients before receiving chemotherapy for metastatic HRPCa, in addition to PSA, computed tomography of the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis [CT-TAP]; and Tc-99m bone scintigraphy. A second AS-MRI was performed in 20 patients who completed 6 months of chemotherapy. Evaluation of tumor response was performed using RECIST. RESULTS: Only 11 patients (29%) had RECIST measurable metastases in soft-tissues or lymph nodes on baseline CT-TAP. AS-MRI identified a diffuse infiltration of the bone marrow in 8 patients and focal measurable metastatic lesions in 25 patients (65%), therefore, doubling the proportion of patients with measurable lesions. Transposing RECIST on AS-MRI in 20 patients who completed 6 months of treatment, allows the accurate estimation of complete response (n = 2), partial response (n = 2), stable disease (n = 5), or tumor progression (n = 11), as it is done using CT-TAP in soft tissue solid metastases.

The authors evaluated the feasibility and efficacy of weekly 1-hour infusion of paclitaxel in patients with metastatic hormone-refractory prostate carcinoma (HRPC). METHODS: A total of 18 patients with progressive metastatic HRPC were enrolled. Patients had to have no prior chemotherapy. Paclitaxel was infused weekly at a dose of 150 mg/m(2) over 1 hour for 6 weeks every 8 weeks. RESULTS: Eighteen patients with a median age of 68.5 years and a median prostate specific antigen (PSA) level of 82 ng/mL (range, 2.17-3196 ng/mL) were enrolled. The median number of prior hormone treatments was 2, and 12 patients on antiandrogens completed antiandrogen withdrawal. Ten of eighteen patients had bone-only metastasis and eight had metastasis to bone with lymph node and/or visceral metastasis. Seventeen patients received a total of 31 cycles (157 courses) and 1 patient refused chemotherapy. All patients were included in response evaluation. Of the 8 [corrected] patients with measurable disease, 4 achieved a major response, with 1 complete response (in the lung) and 3 partial responses (1 in the liver and 2 in the lymph nodes). Seven of eighteen patients (39%) had a PSA decline of >/=50%. The major high grade toxicity was peripheral neuropathy, with 6 patients (35%) developing Grade 3 toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: Weekly 1-hour paclitaxel has activity in patients with HRPC. The major toxicity is peripheral neuropathy. The minimal myelosuppressive effects make a modified schedule (lower doses on the same schedule or a shorter schedule of the same dose) attractive for future combination chemotherapy trials","","","","","","10.1002/1097-0142(20000715)89:2<431::AID-CNCR31>3.0.CO;2-B [pii]","Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Wayne State University and Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute, Detroit, Michigan, USA","PM:10918176","","","",""

Calcitriol has strong antiproliferative effects in prostate, breast, colorectal, head/neck and lung cancer, as well as lymphoma, leukemia and myeloma model systems. Antiproliferative effects are seen in vitro and in vivo. The mechanisms of these effects are associated with G0/G1 arrest, induction of apoptosis, differentiation and modulation of growth factor-mediated signaling in tumor cells. In addition to the direct effects on tumor cells, recent data strongly support the hypothesis that the stromal effects of vitamin D analogs (e.g., direct effects on tumor vasculature) are also important in the antiproliferative effects. Antitumor effects are seen in a wide variety of tumor types and there are few data to suggest that vitamin D-based approaches are more effective in any one tumor type. Glucocorticoids potentiate the antitumor effect of calcitriol and decrease calcitriol-induced hypercalcemia. In addition, calcitriol potentiates the antitumor effects of many cytotoxic agents. Preclinical data indicate that maximal antitumor effects are seen with pharmacological doses of calcitriol and that such exposure can be safely achieved in animals using a high dose, intermittent schedule of administration. AUC and C(max) calcitriol concentrations of 32 ng.h/ml and 9.2 ng/ml are associated with striking antitumor effects in a murine squamous cell carcinoma model and there is increasing evidence from clinical trials that such exposures can be safely attained in patients. Another approach to maximizing intra-tumoral exposure to vitamin D analogs is to inhibit their catabolism. The data clearly indicate that agents which inhibit the major vitamin D catabolizing enzyme, CYP24 (24 hydroxylase), potentiate calcitriol killing of prostate tumor cells in vitro and in vivo. Phase I and II trials of calcitriol, either alone or in combination with carboplatin, taxanes or dexamethasone, as well as the non-specific CYP24 inhibitor, ketoconazole, have been initiated in patients with androgen-dependent and -independent prostate cancer and other advanced cancers. The data indicate that high-dose calcitriol is feasible on an intermittent schedule, no dose-limiting toxicity has been encountered, but the optimal dose and schedule remain to be delineated. Clinical responses have been seen with the combination of high-dose calcitriol + dexamethasone in androgen-independent prostate cancer (AIPC) and, in a large randomized trial in men with AIPC, potentiation of the antitumor effects of docetaxel were seen","","","","","","","Departments of Medicine and Pharmacology, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY 14263, USA. donald.trump@roswellpark.org","PM:16886663","","","",""

The combination of high-dose, intermittent calcitriol (1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3) plus dexamethasone was studied based on evidence that dexamethasone potentiates the antitumor effects of calcitriol and ameliorates hypercalcemia. METHODS: Oral calcitriol was administered weekly, Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday (MTW), at a dose of 8 microg, for 1 month, at a dose of 10 microg every MTW for 1 month, and at a dose of 12 microg every MTW thereafter. Dexamethasone at a dose of 4 mg was administered each Sunday, and MTW weekly. Calcium and creatinine were determined weekly and radiographs of the urinary tract were performed every 3 months. All patients were considered evaluable for toxicity. RESULTS: Forty-three men with androgen-independent prostate cancer were entered; 37 received at least 1 month of calcitriol given at a dose of 12 microg every day x 3 per week. The majority of patients had bone metastases and rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels. All had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1. Eight patients (19%) experienced partial responses by PSA criterion (PSA decline of > or =50%, persisting for > or = 28 days). Subjective clinical improvement occurred in some patients. Toxicity was minimal: urinary tract stones in 2 patients; and a readily reversible, CTC (v.3.0) Grade <2 creatinine increase in 4 patients. Throughout the study only 4 patients ever had a serum calcium level >11.0 mg/dL and no patient had a calcium level >12.0 mg/dL.

We assessed the rate of bone marrow failure in patients with prostate cancer who had received a dose of strontium-89. Patients and Methods: This subgroup analysis involved 34 patients with androgen-independent prostate cancer who had been given a dose of strontium-89 and six weekly doses of doxorubicin after response to induction chemotherapy. We assessed subsequent hematotoxicity in terms of bone marrow failure and the ability to tolerate additional treatments during a median of 25 months (range, 7 to 76 months) after the strontium-89 was administered. Results: No patients developed bone marrow failure within 6 months of receiving strontium-89. Five (15%) of 34 patients developed bone marrow failure at a median 23 months (range, 6 to 53 months) after the strontium-89 treatment. Bone marrow biopsy performed in two of these five patients showed complete replacement of the marrow by tumor. Thirty-one patients (91%) received subsequent cytotoxic treatments at a median 11 months (range, 1 to 33 months) after the strontium-89 treatment. Conclusion: This analysis demonstrated that a single dose of strontium-89 combined with chemotherapy did not affect the delivery of subsequent courses of chemotherapy in a select group of patients. However, a majority of these therapies were given off protocol and were administered at a dose schedule that might be considered inappropriate or inadequate. The clinical role and safety profile of radiopharmaceuticals combined with chemotherapy in prostate cancer therapy deserve further exploration.

We therefore investigated the value of bone-targeted consolidation therapy in selected patients with advanced androgen-independent carcinoma of the prostate. METHODS: 103 patients received induction chemotherapy, consisting of ketoconazole and doxorubicin alternating with estramustine and vinblastine. After two or three cycles of induction chemotherapy, we randomly assigned 72 patients who were clinically stable or responders to receive doxorubicin with or without strontium-89 (Sr-89) every week for 6 weeks. FINDINGS: Overall 62 of the 103 (60%, 95% CI 50-70) patients had a 50% or greater reduction in serum prostate-specific antigen concentration that was maintained for at least 8 weeks, and 43 (42%, 32-52) had an 80% or greater reduction. 49 (52%) patients with bone pain at registration had complete resolution of pain. After follow-up of 67 patients until death, the estimated median survival for all 103 patients was 17.5 months (range 0.5-37.7). For the 36 patients randomly assigned to receive Sr-89 and doxorubicin, the median survival time was 27.7 months (4.9-37.7), and for the 36 who received doxorubicin alone it was 16.8 months (4.4-34.2) (p=0.0014). The hazard ratio was 2.76 (95% CI 1.44-5.29). INTERPRETATION: Bone-targeted consolidation therapy consisting of one dose of Sr-89 plus doxorubicin once a week for 6 weeks, when given to patients with stable or responding advanced androgen-independent carcinoma of the prostate after induction chemotherapy, improved overall survival","","","","","","S0140-6736(00)03639-4 [pii];10.1016/S0140-6736(00)03639-4 [doi]","Department of Genitourinary Medical Oncology, University of Texas, M D Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA. stu@notes.mdacc.tmc.edu","PM:11210994","","","",""

The propensity of prostate cancer to metastasize to bone and the prognostic significance of bone metastasis suggest that effective treatment of bone metastasis may provide clinical benefits. Both osteoblasts and osteoclasts have been shown to play a central role in the interactions between the metastatic prostate cancer cells and bone. Although most prostate cancer bone metastasis is osteoblastic, it remains unclear which cell type is initially involved in the process. Other components in the bone, such as the endothelium and stroma, may also play important roles in this process. The osteoblastic feature of prostate cancer bone metastasis has led to therapies focused on targeting osteoblast activity. Clinical trials targeting osteoblasts use radiopharmaceuticals (strontium-89 and samarium-153), the endothelin A receptor inhibitor atrasentan, or the vitamin D analog calcitriol. Agents that target osteoclasts include bisphosphonates; those that target endothelial cells include thalidomide and bevacizumab. Although these clinical trials for bone metastasis may provide effective treatments, novel concepts of how prostate cancer cells selectively metastasize to bone may advance our understanding and provide improved treatments for this difficult clinical problem. We propose a refined 'seed' and 'soil' view of metastasis. We speculate that in prostate cancer bone metastasis, the seed may comprise the so-called cancer stem cells, whereas the soil may comprise an onco-niche, ie, a unique microenvironment, that facilitate the growth and survival of cancer stem cells. If so, targeting cancer stem cells or the onco-niche may offer another way to improve treatment of prostate cancer bone metastasis","","","","","","10.1097/PPO.0b013e318161d32d [doi];00130404-200801000-00008 [pii]","Department of Genitourinary Medical Oncology, The University of Texas M.

Overall there was limited QoL improvement over 3 months following Sr-89. However, in the 53 patients (63%) achieving pain responses, QoL did significantly improve within 6 weeks of receiving Sr-89 compared to patients with stable or worsening bone pain, and this was independent of other parameters that might influence QoL outcomes, such as performance status, baseline PSA and extent of skeletal disease (P = 0.004). PSA 'response' occurred in 30 patients (37%) over 4 months after Sr-89. This did not appear to correlate with clinical improvement. This study supports the presumption that improvement in pain following Sr-89 is accompanied by better QoL. The lack of correlation of PSA response and clinical parameters indicates that in the palliative setting, PSA may not provide a useful surrogate for treatment outcome","","","","","","10.1054/bjoc.2000.1610 [doi];S0007092000916100 [pii]","Department of Radiation Oncology, Westmead Hospital, NSW, 2145, Australia","PM:11161391","","","",""

The tyrosine kinase inhibitor STI571 blocks the PDGF signaling pathway by inhibiting PDGF-R autophosphorylation. We examined the effects of STI571, given alone or with paclitaxel (Taxol), on tumor growth in a mouse model of prostate cancer metastasis. METHODS: Human prostate cancer PC-3MM2 cells were injected into the tibias of male nude mice. Three days later the mice (20 per group) were randomly assigned to 5 weeks of treatment with oral and injected water (control), daily oral STI571, weekly injected paclitaxel, or STI571 plus paclitaxel. Lesions in bone and the surrounding muscles were then harvested and analyzed by histology, western blotting (for PDGF-R phosphorylation), immunohistochemistry (for expression of proangiogenic molecules), and double immunofluorescence (to identify endothelial cells and apoptotic tumor cells). Growth of bone lesions was monitored by digital radiography. Bone lesions from control mice were used to establish short-term cell cultures for analysis of PDGF-R phosphorylation. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: PC-3MM2 cells cultured from bone lesions and treated in vitro with STI571 had less phosphorylated PDGF-R than untreated cells. In control mice, bone lesions expressed high levels of PDGF and activated (i.e., phosphorylated) PDGF-R, whereas lesions in the adjacent musculature did not. Activated PDGF-R was present on the surface of endothelial cells within the bone lesions but not in endothelial cells of uninjected bone. Mice treated with STI571 or STI571 plus paclitaxel had a lower tumor incidence, smaller tumors, and less bone lysis and lymph node metastasis than mice treated with water or paclitaxel alone (P<.001 for all). Mice treated with STI571 or STI571 plus paclitaxel had less phosphorylated PDGF-R on tumor cells and tumor-associated endothelial cells, less tumor cell proliferation, statistically significantly more apoptotic tumor cells (all P<.001), and fewer tumor-associated endothelial cells (P<.001) than control mice. CONCLUSIONS: Endothelial cells appear to express phosphorylated PDGF-R when they are exposed to tumor cells that express PDGF. Using STI571 to inhibit PDGF-R phosphorylation may, especially in combination with paclitaxel, produce substantial therapeutic effects against prostate cancer bone metastasis","","","","","","","Department of Cancer Biology, The University of Texas M.

The prognostic influence for the survival was analysed for the entity of the primary tumour and the localisation of the spinal metastases. RESULTS: The median survival of the study group was 8.0 months (range: 0-191.5 months). Mamma carcinoma was the most frequent primary tumour with 62 cases (28.6 %). The spinal level of the metastases did not influence the postoperative survival (p = 0.9058). The entity of the primary tumour showed a significant influence for the postoperative survival (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: In spinal metastases, the entity of the primary tumour was of prognostic value; the localisation of the spinal metastases at different spinal levels did not influence the postoperative survival. Therefore, the evaluation of the primary tumour is mandatory for an estimation of the expected survival","","","","","","10.1055/s-2007-960506 [doi]","Orthopadische Universitatsklinik Ulm, RKU, Ulm, Germany","PM:17345541","","","",""

Dolastatin-10 was administered at a dose of 400 microg/m2 i.v. every 3 weeks. Dose escalation to 450 microg/m2 was permitted. Toxicity evaluation was conducted every 2 weeks, and assessment of response was done at the end of every two cycles. Sixteen patients were enrolled between October 1998 to December 1999. The median age was 71 years (range, 59-79 years). Median prostate-specific antigen value was 108 ng/ml (range, 15.3-1672 ng/ml). Of the 15 eligible patients, 7 were Caucasian and 8 were African-American. Eight patients had bone-only metastases, and seven had measurable disease with or without bone metastases. A total of 56 cycles have been administered. Only 2 patients required dose adjustment because of toxicity, and in 5 patients, dose escalation was feasible to 450 microg/m2. The major toxicities observed were grade 3 and 4 neutropenia in 8 patients and grade 3 neuropathy in 1 patient. All 15 patients are evaluable for response. Three patients demonstrated stable disease; 2 of these had bone disease, and 1 had nodal metastasis. All others had disease progression. Dolastatin-10 is very well tolerated in this elderly, pretreated population but lacks significant clinical activity as a single agent","","","","","","","Department of Medicine, Wayne State University, and Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute, Detroit, Michigan 48201, USA","PM:11106233","","","",""

METHODS: Patients were eligible if they had metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma with objective progression or rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels despite androgen deprivation therapy and antiandrogen withdrawal. Prior radiation and/or one prior chemotherapy regimen was permitted. A Zubrod performance status of 2 or less and adequate bone marrow and hepatic and renal function were required. Estramustine was administered orally at a dose of 280 mg three times daily on days 1 to 3, 8 to 10, and 15 to 17. Paclitaxel (150 mg/m2) was administered as a 1-hour intravenous infusion on days 2, 9, and 16. Therapy was repeated every 28 days (one cycle). RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients were enrolled (median age 71.5 years). Fifteen patients had measurable disease (nine nodal and seven visceral) and 13 had bone-only metastases. A total of 116 cycles of therapy were delivered (median 4 cycles per patient, range 1 to 12). Nine patients required dose reduction. The predominant toxicities consisted of grade 3 neuropathy in 6 patients and grade 3 and 4 neutropenia in 4 patients, with one hospitalization for febrile neutropenia. Three patients had thrombotic manifestations: one deep venous thrombosis and two non-Q wave myocardial infarctions. Of the 28 patients, 26 were assessable for response. Of 13 patients with measurable disease, 5 demonstrated a partial response (1 in the liver and 4 in the lymph nodes), and 8 of 13 patients with bone-only metastases had a 50% or greater decrease in PSA level.

Hence, a phase II trial was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of estramustine and etoposide in hormone-sensitive metastatic prostate cancer. PATIENT AND METHODS: Eligibility consisted of untreated metastatic prostate cancer, adequate organ function, and a performance status of 0 to 2 by Zubrod criteria. A 21-day schedule of oral estramustine (10 mg/kg/day) and etoposide (50 mg/m2/day) was administered every 28 days. Hormonal therapy was allowed at the end of the protocol therapy. Toxicity was assessed weekly, PSA levels were assessed with each cycle, and objective response was evaluated every 3 cycles. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients were enrolled (10 white, 11 black) with a median age of 59.5 years (range, 42-79 years), a median PSA of 338 ng/mL (range, 0.9-20,000 ng/mL), and a median Gleason score of 8 points. Ten patients had bone-only metastases, 11 had measurable disease, of whom 4 had visceral metastases. A total of 128 cycles were administered (median, 6 cycles). No dose reductions were required. Nineteen patients were able to be evaluated for response. Severe toxicities included thromboembolic events and anemia in 2 patients each and fatigue in 1 patient. There were no episodes of febrile neutropenia. Response was observed in 8 of 11 patients (73%) with measurable disease. Median PSA nadir after therapy was 0.45 ng/mL, and undetectable PSA (<0.1 ng/mL) was achieved in 4 patients. Median time to PSA progression was 16.65 months. At a median follow-up of 34 months, 18 patients were alive. The 1-, 2-, and 3-year overall survival rates were 90%, 82%, and 72% respectively. Median survival has not yet been reached.

One of the most important areas of current development in radionuclide cancer therapy is the monotherapeutic use of new or already available radiopharmaceuticals in preclinical or phase I studies and to a lesser degree in phase II trials. In this context, the radioimmunotherapy is showing important advances in the treatment of medullary thyroid carcinoma, malignant lymphomas en brain tumours with potential extension to neuroblastoma therapy. The development of DOTA as a chelating agent has lead to the use of Y-90-DOTATOC in the treatment of neuroendocrine tumours, particularly carcinoid tumours, and non-I131I-avid thyroid carcinomas. In an effort to improve tumour targeting together with simultaneous reduction of physiological organ uptake, 131I-MIBG is being used in combination with interferon a and pre-targeting with unlabelled MIBG in the treatment of carcinoid tumours. New routes of administration of radiopharmaceuticals (intratumoral, intra-arterial) have enhanced the treatment of malignancies of liver, pancreas and brain as well as the potential use of radioimmunotherapy by intravesical administration for bladder carcinoma. Another significant tendency in radionuclide therapy is its evolution from monotherapy towards a combined application with other anticancer modalities. Some recent examples of combined therapy with demonstrated anti-tumour effect are found in neuroblastoma (131I-MIBG and chemotherapy), bone metastases of prostatic carcinoma (addition of 89Sr to chemotherapy schedules), brain malignancies (adjuvant use of radioimmnunotherapy in relation to surgery and external radiotherapy) and lymphoma (radioimmunotherapy combined with chemotherapy or immunotherapy). Reinforcing this trend in phase II and III studies as well as the planning of multicenter trials following the guidelines and criteria of clinical oncology will determine the future advances in this field","","","","","","13021400 [pii]","Instituto Holandes del Cancer, Amsterdam, Holanda. valdes@nki.nl","PM:11709141","","","",""

Patients with locally confined PC are treated with either radiotherapy or surgery. However, treatment of more advanced stages of the disease is problematic. Initially, androgen deprivation offers a period of clinical stability, which is however invariably followed by progression to non-responsiveness to hormonal manipulation. Current management of patients with androgen-independent prostate cancer (AIPC) displays modest response rates and achieves only short-term benefit. Recently, knowledge in the complex pathophysiology of advanced PC has led to the identification of mechanisms and target molecules permitting the introduction of new therapies. Consequently, many investigational treatments are ongoing for AIPC in Phase-II and Phase-III trials aiming at the combination of chemotherapeutic regimens along with immunotherapy targeting PC-associated antigens. Other attractive options are gene therapy, as well as the targeting of survival signaling, differentiation, and apoptosis of the malignant PC cells. Further treatment modalities are directed against the tumor microenvironment, bone metastasis, or both. Collectively, the aforementioned efforts introduce a new era in the management of advanced PC. Novel pharmaceutical compounds and innovative approaches, integrated into the concept of individualized therapy will hopefully, during the next decade, improve the outcome and survival for hundreds of thousands of men worldwide.

The left index finger was placed in the rectum to control the prostatorectal dissection. We call this procedure 'finger assisted laparoscopy.' RESULTS: Average operating time was 190 minutes (range 170 to 210), average blood loss was 387 cc (range 50 to 1,100) and no patient was transfused. Bladder catheter was removed after an average of 13 days because of the slower tissue healing after irradiation. No death or intraoperative complication occurred.

Preclinical studies with temozolomide, an oral alkylating agent, in prostate cancer have shown encouraging results. In phase I studies the safety of temozolomide in non-prostate cancer patients has been demonstrated. Based on these results, a phase II study of temozolomide in patients with metastatic disease who had developed progressive symptomatic disease while on antiandrogen therapy, was initiated. METHODS: A group of 18 patients started a 5-day temozolomide regimen, with a 28-day treatment cycle. Response parameters (prostate-specific antigen, bone scan, quality of life questionnaire) and toxicity (common toxicity criteria for international studies) were recorded at regular intervals. RESULTS: Of the 18 patients, 16 were evaluable by completing two or three cycles. All patients developed progressive disease within two cycles, except one who had progressive disease at the end of cycle 3. Of the 16 evaluable patients, 11 developed new bone metastases (bone scan), 1 developed lung metastases, 4 had progressive disease as reflected by a 25% increase in serum PSA together with subjective progression, and 7 and 5 had progressive disease as reflected by decreased quality of life and increased pain score, respectively. Toxicity was limited to nausea and vomiting, which was effectively treated with antiemetic medication, and anemia and thrombocytopenia, which returned to normal values within 1 week. DISCUSSION: Treatment with temozolomide was generally well tolerated, with occasionally moderate toxicity. As all patients developed progressive disease the results are rather discouraging. Temozolomide is ineffective for the treatment of patients with symptomatic progressive hormone-refractory prostate cancer","","","","","","","Department of Urology, Erasmus University and Academic Hospital Rotterdam, The Netherlands","PM:10854140","","","",""

To determine whether a single fraction of radiotherapy is as effective as multiple fractions for the palliation of painful bone metastases. Design. Prospective, randomised, open. Patients and method., In the period from 1 March 1996 to 31 August 1998, patients with painful bone metastases were randomised between i fraction of 8 Gy (on 1 day) and 6 fractions of 4 Gy (during 1,5 week). Frequent questionnaires were mailed to them to collect information on pain, consumption of analgesics, side effects and quality of life, and regarding matters from which the medical and other costs could be derived. Pain response was defined as a decrease of at least two points compared to the initial pain score (on a scale from 0 = no pain to 10 = the worst imaginable pain). If the pain score decreased to 0 or 1, this was interpreted as a complete response. Results. Of the 1157 patients treated (624 men and 533 women with an age range of 32-89 years), 579 received a single dose and 578 received 6 fractions. The primary tumour was mammary carcinoma in 39%, carcinoma of the prostate in 23 %, pulmonary carcinoma in 25% and others in 13%. Metastases were found in the spinal column (30%), pelvis (36%), femur (10%), ribs (8%), humerus (6%) and other sites (10%). Overall, 71% patients achieved a pain response and 35% a complete pain response. There was no difference between the two treatment groups in pain reduction. There was also no difference between the two groups with regard to the use of analgesics, side effects and overall quality of life. Single-dose irradiation was less expensive than repeated irradiation (6855-5078 = 1777 euros). Conclusion. Single-dose radiotherapy is as effective as fractionated radiotherapy in the treatment of painful bone metastases, while it is less expensive and is not accompanied by any more side effects.

Patients and Methods: Clinical data from 60 hormone refractory PCA patients (i.e. rising PSA at castrate testosterone serum levels) was obtained. Twenty-nine were treated with Sr89, 31 were treated with Re186-HEDP for painful osseous metastasis. Response was defined as a patient-reported decrease in pain and/or reduction in pain medication with stable pain level. Hematological parameters and serum levels of PSA, alkaline phosphatase, and lactate dehydrogenase were assessed pr ior to and at 4-week intervals after treatment. Results: Median survival of all patients was 7 months (95% CI: 6-9 months). Overall, 33/60 (55%) patients reported a decrease in pain after the first radionuclide treatment. This percentage was similar for patients treated with Re168-HEDP and Sr89. Mean duration of reported pain response was 75 days (+/- 68 days) for Sr89 and 61 days (+/- 56 days) for Re186-HEDP, which was not significantly different. A lower blood hemoglobin concentration was associated with a lower pain response rate. In a multivariate Cox regression analysis, pain response to radionuclide treatment predicted longer survival after treatment. Conclusions: Pain response was present in 55% of patients. Serum hemoglobin concentration prior to radionuclide treatment predicted pain response for both Re186-HEDP and Sr89. A reduction in pain upon radionuclide treatment was associated with a longer survival after treatment. Copyright (c) 2006 S. Karger AG","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In hormone refractory prostate cancer multiple painful metastases can be treated with radionuclides. Initially, Strontium-89 was successfully used for pain palliation with pain relief in more than half the patients. More recently, radionuclides with shorter physical half-lives such as Rhenium and Samarium were shown to result in similar pain reduction rates, possibly lower myelosuppression incidences, and at least earlier recovery of hematological parameters allowing repetitive dosing. The low number of randomized trials on radionuclides in prostate cancer does prohibit proper selection based on efficacy and toxicity. Hence application is often dependent on local availability of the different radionuclides. (c) 2007 European Association of Urology and European Board of Urology","","","","","","","","","","","",""

MATERIALS AND METHODS: After a 4-week placebo period, eligible patients received orally 2,000 units vitamin D daily for 12 weeks. Pain questionnaires and measurements of muscle strength were competed at study enrollment and every 4 weeks thereafter. Serum calcium and vitamin D were measured at each clinic visit. RESULTS: A total of 16 patients with advanced hormone refractory prostate cancer were enrolled in this phase II study, of whom 7 (44%) had decreased baseline vitamin D. With vitamin D treatment, 4 patients (25%) had improvement in pain scores and 6 (37%) had improvement in muscle strength measurements. Improvement in pain scores correlated with improvement in subjective symptoms but did not result in a significant decrease in regular scheduled analgesic requirements. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D deficiency develops in a significant percent of patients with advanced hormone refractory prostate cancer. Supplementation with vitamin D may be a useful adjunct for improving pain, muscle strength and quality of life in this patient population","","","","","","S0022-5347(05)68001-9 [pii]","Department of Internal Medicine, Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Kansas City, Missouri 64128, USA","PM:10604343","","","",""

This study was conducted to evaluate the feasibility and safety of reirradiation with image-guided radiosurgery using CyberKnife, a robotic arm-driven compact linear accelerator, for intraprostatic recurrence after external beam radiotherapy (EBRT). METHODS: Between September 2007 and May 2008, 6 patients diagnosed with locally recurrent prostate cancer after EBRT were treated using the CyberKnife system. The total reirradiation dose was 30 Gy in five fractions. Prior to radiosurgery four patients were treated with androgen-deprivation therapy. Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer criteria and the Houston-Phoenix definition (PSA nadir + 2 ng/mL) were used for toxicity and biochemical failure evaluation, respectively. RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 11.2 months (range, 9.6-18.6 months), all patients are alive with no evidence of severe urinary or rectal acute morbidity. Local control cannot be exactly determined due to the short follow-up and the bias of the use of androgen ablation. Four patients had biochemical failure, three of them with clinical failure evidence (lymph node, bone and lung metastasis, respectively): none of these patients had clinical evidence of tumor persistence in the prostate. CONCLUSIONS: Salvage radiosurgery with CyberKnife after irradiation is feasible with low urinary and rectal morbidity. A longer follow-up and a larger number of patients are necessary to evaluate its effectiveness and optimal patient selection criteria","","","","","","","Department of Radiotherapy, European Institute of Oncology Milan, Italy. andrea.vavassori@ieo.it","PM:20437861","","","",""

The skeleton is a frequent and clinically relevant site of metastasis in cancer patients. The major events related to bone metastases include bone pain, bone loss, hypercalcemia, spinal cord compression, and fractures. On the basis of their radiographic features, bone metastases are classified as osteoblastic, osteoclastic, or mixed. The primary goals of treatment of bone metastases are reduction of the risk of pathological fractures and other skeletal-related events, and pain control. Bisphosphonates are used to prevent pathological fractures by inhibition of osteoclasts. Recent studies suggest that bisphosphonates have some direct antitumoral activity, mainly mediated through the blockade of angiogenic pathways. Further clinical studies are needed to determine the optimal treatment duration, timing and schedule of bisphosphonates, assess their role as adjuvant therapy for the prevention of bone metastases, and establish their antiangiogenic activity in association with standard cytotoxic and hormonal drugs for treatment of patients with advanced disease","","","","","","","Division of Medical Oncology, San Filippo Neri Hospital, Rome, Italy","PM:17393358","","","",""

Even if the cancer is considered localized to the prostate, there is a 15% to 20% incidence of subsequent metastatic disease. Prostate cancer has a very high proclivity for metastasizing to bone, with approximately 90% of men with advanced disease having skeletal lesions. The prostate cancer metastases are characteristically osteoblastic, with extensive new bone deposition, unlike other tumors that metastasize to bone and cause an osteolytic response reflective of bone degradation. There are a considerable number of studies relating to inhibition of the osteoblastic response, including interference with endothelin-1, bone morphogenetic proteins, and Wnt signaling pathways. Within the past few years, several studies showed that increased osteolytic activity also occurs in the background of the prostate cancer skeletal metastases. Because growth factors are being released from the bone matrix during degradation, it suggests that inhibition of osteolysis might be effective in slowing tumor growth. Several strategies are being developed and applied to affect directly the osteolytic events, including use of bisphosphonates and targeting the critical biological regulators of osteoclastogenesis, receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB and receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand. This review focuses on several of the clinical and preclinical strategies to inhibit the growth of prostate cancer cells in bone and to alleviate the multitude of associated skeletal-related events","","","","","","12/20/6285s [pii];10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-06-0813 [doi]","Department of Urology, University of Washington Medical Center and Puget Sound Veterans Administration Health Care System, Seattle, Washington 98195, USA. vessella@u.washington.edu","PM:17062715","","","",""

Of 638 patients, 415 patients (65%) had received prior bisphosphonate therapy. Fatigue, nausea, and arthralgia were the most frequent AEs. Nausea was more common in bisphosphonate-naive patients. SCr levels increased notably in 6.6% of patients: 7.7% of patients who received prior bisphosphonate therapy and 4.5% of bisphosphonate-naive patients. Treatment was delayed because of SCr-level increases in 1.4% of patients with prior bisphosphonate exposure and 0.4% of bisphosphonate-naive patients. SCr-level increases and treatment delays did not correlate with duration of prior bisphosphonate therapy. There was a trend towards more treatment discontinuations in patients with prior bisphosphonate exposure compared with bisphosphonate-naive patients. Pain scores decreased from baseline; total QOL scores remained constant. The results of this study suggest that, with proper SCr-level monitoring, cancer patients with bone metastases who have previously received intravenous bisphosphonate treatment can be safely converted to zoledronic acid therapy","","","","","","9/6/687 [pii];10.1634/theoncologist.9-6-687 [doi]","Cancer Research Network, 350 NW 84th Avenue, Suite 305, Plantation, Florida 33324, USA. drcvogel@aol.com","PM:15561812","","","",""

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 2001 and June 2003, 14 patients with HRPC were treated; their mean (range) age was 71 (57-86) years and mean prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level 202 (6-489) ng/mL. Five patients had had previous chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide in two, mitoxantrone-prednisolone in three). The response criteria were the Karnofsky performance status, a positive response in mean daily analgesic consumption (defined as a decrease by more than half), decreased serum PSA (by more than half) at 8 weeks, blood transfusion, bone scan at 6 months, skeletal-related events and survival. RESULTS: Patients received a mean (range) of 7.3 (6-10) cycles of therapy; there was no reported drug-related toxicity and all patients stayed at home for their treatment. Only three patients required a blood transfusion and no bone fractures were reported. At 2 months, six patients requiring analgesic drugs decreased their consumption by more than half (anti-inflammatory, paracetamol, narcotics) and eight had a reduction in PSA by more than half; of these eight with a PSA response at 2 months, six had biochemical progression with a mean delay of 6.2 (3-11) months. At 6 months, five patients had disease progression on bone scan. Nine patients had chemo-naive hormone-refractory prostate cancer; three had biochemical progression at 2 months and two of these had progression on their bone scan. Two patients died at 7 and 15 months of follow-up; the mean follow-up was 10.2 (6-15) months. Using Kaplan-Meier plots, biochemical progression-free survivals were five of 14 at 6 months and two of 14 at 12 months; overall survival was 12 of 14 at 6 and 12 months. CONCLUSION: Docetaxel-zoledronic acid therapy is safe and decreased the serum PSA by more than half at 2 months in more than half the patients.

PATIENTS AND METHODS Fifty-eight osteoporotic men with non-metastatic prostate cancer were followed for 3 years. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either LHRHA (29) or bicalutamide (29). All received 4 mg ZA 3-monthly for 1 year. BMD was measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry at four times: 1 year before ZA; immediately before ZA; after five infusions; and 1 year afterwards. Bone turnover markers (BTMs) were measured at 3-monthly intervals on ZA and 1 year later. All patients had radiography of the thoracolumbar spine at baseline and after ZA. RESULTS Patients on LHRHA showed a 4.9% decrease in BMD before ZA, a 1.6% increase after ZA and a 3.0% decrease 1 year later, compared to 2.0% increase, 7.8% increase and 1.9% decrease, respectively, in those on bicalutamide. BTMs decreased significantly after ZA. Seven patients (12%) had vertebral fractures at baseline, with none deteriorating at 1 year; two (3.5%) developed mandibular osteonecrosis. CONCLUSION Before ZA, BMD decreased on LHRHA, but was maintained on bicalutamide. Treatment with 3-monthly ZA increased BMD and suppressed BTMs in osteoporotic patients both on LHRHA and bicalutamide, but to a greater extent in the latter. However, 1 year after the last infusion, BMD declined, suggesting that annual administration is inadequate in these patients. The optimum frequency might be related to BMD at time of bisphosphonate initiation","","","","","","BJU8956 [pii];10.1111/j.1464-410X.2009.08956.x [doi]","Department of Urology, Wirral University Teaching Hospitals, Wirral, UK","PM:19912210","","","",""

Patients aged over 80 years were excluded from the study. As for the treatment methodology, diethylstilbestrol diphosphate (DES-P) at 500 mg/day was intravenously injected for 20-40 days, followed by monotherapy with an analog of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH). In all subjects, surgical castration was not conducted. The survival rate was analysed according to the method of Kaplan-Meier. RESULTS: One of the 35 patients was excluded from the study as this patient did not meet the inclusion criteria. There were four patients who dropped out of the study. On histology, 17 patients had moderately differentiated adenocarcinomas and 17 patients had poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas.

METHOD: Patients with metastatic CRPC received low-dose chemotherapy with capecitabine 1 g twice daily plus dexamethasone 1 mg daily for 14 days every 3 weeks, COX-2 blockade with rofecoxib 25 mg (or etoricoxib 60 mg) daily combined with pioglitazone 60 mg daily until disease progression. RESULTS: Thirty-six consecutive patients with metastatic CRPC were enrolled, of whom n = 18 (50%) had been extensively pretreated with radio- or radionuclid therapy and n = 16 (44%) with chemotherapies; n = 8 patients (22%) were medically none-fit, having an ECOG-score of 0-2. Nine of 15 patients with PSA response >50% showed objective response. Median time to PSA response was 2.4 months (range 1.0-7.3 months). Two of 9 patients responding with PSA < 4 ng/ml showed complete resolution of skeletal lesions after 9 and 16 months; 13 patients had a stable course of disease, and 5 patients experienced progressive disease. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 4.0 months (2.8-5.1 months) and median overall survival (OS) 14.4 months (10.7-17.2 months). Toxicities according to WHO grade II were noticed in 9 patients. CONCLUSIONS: This new combined modular therapy approach is able to induce major responses including resolution of skeletal lesions in patients with CRPC.

Since 2003, a previously unknown side-effect of bisphosphonates-bisphosphonate-associated osteonecrosis of the jaws (BP-ONJ)-has been described, and frequency has since increased. An exact incidence is still unknown. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the incidence and additional factors in the development of BP-ONJ. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: From July 2006 to October 2007, patients with advanced pCA and osseous metastasis receiving bisphosphonate therapy in the Department of Urology or Haematology and Oncology at the Johannes-Gutenberg-University Mainz, Germany, received a dental examination. In all, 43 patients were included. MEASUREMENTS: Patients were checked for exposed bone, osteonecrosis, mucosal defects, inflammation, and oral hygiene. Further points were the applied bisphosphonate, co-medication, the duration of application, and possible trigger factors for BP-ONJ. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Eight of 43 patients developed BP-ONJ (18.6%). All patients had received zoledronate at least 14 times. Two patients had received bondronate, and one patient had received pamidronate before switching to zoledronate. All patients had had a previous tooth extraction or a denture pressure sore, and all patients had received additional chemotherapy and corticosteroids. CONCLUSIONS: The reason for this relatively high incidence compared to other studies might be the prospective study design and thorough dental examination. In studies with such small numbers as have been published to date, nondetection or nonreported cases of BP-ONJ have an influence on the outcome. The incidence of BP-ONJ in patients with pCA might be an underestimated problem","","","","","","S0302-2838(08)00777-X [pii];10.1016/j.eururo.2008.06.070 [doi]","Klinik fur Mund-, Kiefer- und Gesichtschirurgie, Johannes Gutenberg-Universitat Mainz, Mainz, Germany. walter@mkg.klinik.uni-mainz.de","PM:18602738","","","",""

Among the various therapeutic approaches being considered for this application, gene-modified cell-based therapies may have specific advantages. Gene-modified cell therapy uses gene transfer and cell-based technologies in a complementary fashion to chaperone appropriate gene expression cassettes to active sites of tumor growth. In this paper, we briefly review potential cell vehicles for this approach and discuss relevant gene therapy strategies for prostate cancer. We further discuss selected studies that led to the conceptual development and preclinical testing of IL-12 gene-modified bone marrow cell therapy for prostate cancer. Finally, we discuss future directions in the development of gene-modified cell therapy for metastatic prostate cancer, including the need to identify and test novel therapeutic genes such as GLIPR1","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study was designed to investigate the clinical and prognostic significance of Mel-18 in patients with prostate cancer. A total of 539 native Japanese subjects consisting of 393 prostate cancer patients and 146 controls were enrolled in this study. Mel-18 genotyping was analyzed using a PCR-RFLP method and an automated sequencer using the GENESCAN software. Immunohistochemistry revealed that Mel-18 expression was diminished in high grade and high stage prostate cancers. Moreover, patients with positive Mel-18 expression had significantly longer PSA recurrence-free survival than patients negative for Mel-18 expression (p=0.038). A Mel-18 1805A/G SNP was located in the 3' untranslated region and was predicted to alter the secondary structure of the mRNA. Mel-18 mRNA expression of the 1805A allele was clearly higher than expression of the 1805G allele by allele specific quantitative RT-PCR. In multivariate analysis, a homozygous G allele genotype and negative Mel-18 expression were independent risk factors predicting high PSA recurrence after radical prostatectomy, with HRs of 2.757 (p=0.022) and 2.271 (p=0.045), respectively. Moreover, the G allele was also an independent predictor of poor cancer-specific survival with an HR of 4.658 (p=0.019) for patients with stage D2 prostate cancer. This is the first study to provide important evidence demonstrating that Mel-18 is a tumor suppressor and possible therapeutic target, as well as a diagnostic marker for poor prognosis in prostate cancer patients","","","","","","10.1002/ijc.24721 [doi]","Department of Urology, Guangzhou Liuhuaqiao Hospital, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China","PM:19585577","","","",""

Compositional analyses indicate that TSU was randomly distributed in the hydrophobic blocks. When the TSU content in the co-polymers increased, the polymer crystallinity decreased progressively and the glass transition temperature increased accordingly. The hydrophobic, anticancer drug, camptothecin (CPT), was successfully encapsulated in the block co-polymer nanoparticles. The CPT encapsulation efficiency and release kinetics were strongly dependent on the co-polymer composition and crystallinity. CPT release from nanoparticles constructed from co-polymers containing 0, 39 and 100 mol% TSU in the hydrophobic block followed the same trend, with an initial burst of approx. 40% within one day followed by a moderate and slow release lasting up to 7 days. At a TSU content of 14 mol%, CPT was released in a continuous and controlled fashion with a reduced initial burst and a 73% cumulative release by day 7. The in vitro cytoxicity assay showed that the blank nanoparticles were not toxic to the cultured bone metastatic prostate cancer cells (C4-2B). Compared to the free drug, the encapsulated CPT was more effective in inducing apoptotic responses in C4-2B cells. Modulating the physical characteristics of the amphiphilic co-polymers via co-polymerization offers a facile method for controlling the bioavailability of anticancer drugs, ultimately increasing effectiveness and minimizing toxicity","","","","","","jbs3166 [pii];10.1163/092050610X504260 [doi]","","PM:20594408","","","",""

We identified the incidence of bone metastases at varying prostate specific antigen levels in asymptomatic men following radical prostatectomy, radiation therapy and watchful waiting. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data were obtained from the Early Prostate Cancer trial comparing placebo with bicalutamide in addition to standard care for localized prostate cancer. As part of the trial patients were required to have routine bone scans regardless of prostate specific antigen levels. The prostate specific antigen levels were divided into subgroups and the incidence of positive bone scans was calculated for each group. RESULTS: The incidence of positive bone scans in patients treated with watchful waiting and given bicalutamide or placebo was low (0.7% to 3.2%) at prostate specific antigen levels less than 20 ng/ml. At greater than this level the sample sizes were smaller but there was a significant increase in the incidence of positive bone scans. In the groups treated with radiation therapy or radical prostatectomy, regardless of the addition of bicalutamide, the incidence of positive bone scans was low (0.2% to 1.4%) at prostate specific antigen levels less than 5 ng/ml. The sample sizes were smaller at prostate specific antigen levels greater than 5 ng/ml so the results are harder to interpret. CONCLUSIONS: Bone scans can be confidently eliminated in the followup of patients with early prostate cancer after standard care of those with prostate specific antigen levels less than 5 ng/ml. This level can be increased to 20 ng/ml with caution in those patients treated with watchful waiting","","","","","","S0022-5347(06)00633-1 [pii];10.1016/S0022-5347(06)00633-1 [doi]","Midwest Urology Research Foundation, 4646 North Marine Drive, Chicago, IL 60640, USA. katherinewarren@hotmail.com","PM:16753371","","","",""

Activation of the ET(A) receptor by endothelin-1 (ET-1) promotes cell proliferation and survival in these tumors, whereas activation of the endothelin B (ET(B)) receptor results in an opposing effect. Therefore, blockade of ET(A) may have antitumor effects, while sparing ET(B)-mediated effects such as induction of apoptosis and clearance of ET-1. OBJECTIVE: ZD4054 is an orally bioavailable, specific ET(A) antagonist currently being investigated in prostate cancer. In receptor-binding studies, ZD4054 only bound to ET(A), with no binding detected towards ET(B). Prostate cancer cell lines are known to produce ET-1 and there is a relative increase in expression of ET(A) to ET(B) in these cancers. There is also an association of greater ET(A) expression in higher grade versus lower grade tumors, suggesting that ET(A) may be involved in the malignant transformation process. As ET-1 may also mediate nociceptive effects and osteoblastic effects, there is much interest in clinically assessing ZD4054 in prostate cancer. METHODS: The data describing the endothelin axis, the role of ET(A) and ET(B) in malignancy, and the effects of ET(A) antagonist ZD4054 in prostate cancer, as demonstrated in preclinical and clinical studies, are reviewed. RESULTS: Further investigation of ZD4054 in prostate cancer is warranted, and Phase III trials are already planned in patients with non-metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) with rising prostate specific antigen values, metastatic (asymptomatic) CRPC, and in metastatic CRPC in combination with docetaxel, assessing either differences in progression-free survival and overall survival or overall survival alone","","","","","","10.1517/13543784.17.8.1237 [doi]","University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Health Sciences Learning Center, 750 Highland Avenue, Madison, WI 53705, USA","PM:18616419","","","",""

It can be said that prostate cancer morbidity rises with age in old men. The natural history of prostate cancer is rather simple. The majority of patients who are diagnosed with localized prostate cancer are treated with curative intent with either radiation or surgery. Patients in whom treatment with curative intent is unsuccessful and those who present with metastasis are candidates for androgen suppression. Skeletal-related events are defined by the existence of changes in antineoplastic therapy to treat bone pain, pathological bone fractures, radiation therapy to bone, spinal cord compression, and surgery to bone. Bone pathology correlates with cancer course and has been shown to influence survival. Pathobiology provides new insights into mechanisms responsible for bone metastases related to prostate cancer. Several studies have evaluated risk factors for bone loss and fractures in prostate cancer patients receiving androgen-deprivation therapy. The three risk factors that have been reliably identified in patients with locally advanced disease are older age, low body mass index and a long duration of androgen-deprivation therapy. In metastatic prostate cancer, the sole reliable risk factor is elevated levels of deoxypyridinoline. Zol edronic acid has a crucial impact on combined therapy with hormones, then with chemotherapy, and additionally can be used in the prevention of osteoporosis/osteopenia related to cancer treatment","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Since the well-known down-regulation of cytokeratin 18 in tumor cells may lead to false-negative results, we asked whether staining with a pan-cytokeratin antibody recognizing a common epitope of cytokeratins 8, 18 and 19 would result in different data. Materials and Methods: Preoperative bone marrow aspirates of 82 patients with localized (NO) and lymphatically spread (N1) prostate cancer were exa mined using the monoclonal antibody cytokeratin 2 and the pan-cytokeratin antibody A 45-B/B3, called A 45. Results: In contrast to findings with the cytokeratin 18 antibody, those with the pan-cytokeratin antibody correlated with the biochemical course. At a median followup of 1,477 days (4 years) patients with pan-cytokeratin positive cells in the preoperative bone marrow aspirate had biochemical progression significantly earlier than those with pan-cytokeratin negative results (mean time to prostate specific antigen relapse 886 versus 1,409 days, p <=0.004). Compared with other parameters, such as prostate specific antigen, pathological stage and Gleason score, preoperative pan-cytokeratin findings proved to be an independent prognostic factor. Conclusions: Cytokeratin positive cells in the bone marrow also have prognostic relevance in prostate cancer. The comprehensive analysis of these cells, studies of the individual course of these findings and sufficiently long followup allow us to discuss whether and under what conditions m etastasis may develop from i or several cytokeratin positive cells","","","","","","","","","","","",""

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data were from a clinical trial of zoledronic acid versus placebo in the treatment of SREs associated with advanced prostate cancer metastatic to bone. Patients (n=248) were included if they experienced an SRE during the study. Outcome measures were assessed at fixed intervals. We used mixed-effects models to estimate changes in outcomes after each patient's first SRE. RESULTS: There were clinically meaningful and statistically significant declines in physical well-being after: radiation and pathologic fractures; functional well-being after radiation; and emotional well-being after radiation and pathologic fractures. There also were meaningful and significant declines in preference and utility scores after radiation and fracture. Pain intensity declined after radiation, but not after other SREs; no other pain measure changed substantively. CONCLUSIONS: SREs have important and significant effects on measures of health-related quality of life in men with prostate cancer. Treatments that prevent SREs may not demonstrate corresponding effects on outcomes if the effects of SREs occur between scheduled outcome assessments.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a trial of zoledronic acid (n = 214) versus placebo (n = 208), we used the Brief Pain Inventory to assess pain at baseline, 3 weeks, 6 weeks and every 6 weeks thereafter for a total of 60 weeks. We used a modified longitudinal rank test to determine whether clinically meaningful changes in pain were related to treatment group. RESULTS: Seventy-six of 214 patients (35.5%) receiving zoledronic acid and 62 of 208 patients (29.8%) receiving placebo completed the 60-week visit (P = 0.22). In all 11 pain assessments, patients receiving zoledronic acid reported more favorable, clinically meaningful changes in pain scores. Overall, patients receiving zoledronic acid had a 33% chance of a favorable response, compared with 25% for patients receiving placebo (P = 0.04; 95% CI 0.5% to 15.6%).

Just prior to the ASH meeting, Amgen received approval of denosumab for oncology indications. The antibody against RANK ligand, already approved as Prolia(R) for osteoporosis, will need to demonstrate advantages over its primary competitor zoledronate, a bisphosphonate. Multiple myeloma data presented at the ASH meeting defined zoledronate's ability to slow progression of disease as well as promote bone health, giving zoledronate a clear advantage over denosumab in myeloma.

Zoledronic acid demonstrated efficacy in the reduction of skeletalrelated events (SREs) in patients with multiple myeloma or bone metastases secondary to breast cancer, prostate cancer or other solid tumours, or hypercalcaemia of malignancy. Zoledronic acid was effective in patients with multiple myeloma or metastatic breast cancer with osteolytic or mixed bone lesions. The proportion of patients who experienced an SRE was similar during 12 months of treatment with zoledronic acid 4mg or pamidronic acid 90mg, but significantly fewer patients receiving zoledronic acid required radiotherapy to bone. Furthermore, in patients with breast cancer and osteolytic lesions, median time to a first SRE was more than 4 months longer with zoledronic acid than with pamidronic acid. In the multiple event analysis in a 12-month extension study (total study duration was 25 months) in patients with breast cancer, zoledronic acid was superior to pamidronic acid, with an 18% reduction in the risk of experiencing an SRE. Both drugs were associated with a slight reduction in pain. Zoledronic acid 4mg, compared with placebo, significantly reduced the proportion of patients with prostate cancer bone metastases experiencing an SRE, particularly pathological fractures after 15 months' treatment. The drug also significantly delayed the onset of skeletal complications compared with placebo in patients with prostate cancer and other solid tumours including non-small cell lung cancer. When administered as a single 15-minute intravenous infusion, zoledronic acid 4mg was significantly more effective than pamidronic acid administered as a 2-hour infusion in the treatment of severe hypercalcaemia of malignancy, as assessed by complete responses measuring normalised serum calcium concentrations at day 10 after a single dose. Furthermore, zoledronic acid normalised serum calcium concentrations significantly faster than pamidronic acid, and the duration of response and median time to relapse were approximately twice as long in zoledronic acid recipients than in pamidronic acid recipients. Zoledronic acid is well tolerated and has a similar tolerability profile to pamidronic acid. The most commonly reported adverse events included flu-like symptoms (fever, arthralgias, myalgias and bone pain), fatigue, gastrointestinal reactions, anaemia, weakness, dyspnoea and oedema. CONCLUSION: In conjunction with antitumour therapy, zoledronic acid should be considered for routine use to reduce skeletal complications in patients with advanced malignancies involving bone. In patients with hypercalcaemia of malignancy, zoledronic acid is expected to become the treatment of choice","","","","","","630409 [pii]","Adis International Limited, Auckland, New Zealand. demail@adis.co.nz","PM:12558465","","","",""

In 10 randomly selected patients radionuclide distribution and its time course was determined via regions of interest (ROIs) over prostate, urinary bladder, liver, spleen and the lymph nodes. The uptake in the SLNs was estimated from gamma probe measurements at the surgically removed nodes. To compare tumour positive with tumour free lymph nodes according to SLN-uptake and SLN-localisation we evaluated 108 lymph nodes out of 24 patients with tumour positive SLN. For calculating the effective dose according to ICRP 60 of the patients we used the MIRD-method and the Mirdose 3.1 software. RESULTS: The average uptake of separate organs was: bladder content 24%, liver 25.5%, spleen 2%, sum of SLN 0.5%. An average of 9% of the applied activity remained in the prostate. The residual activity was mainly accumulated in bone marrow and blood. Occasionally a weak activity enrichment in intestinal tract and kidneys could be recognized. The effective dose to the patient was estimated to 7.6 microSv/MBq. The radioactivity uptake of the SLN varied in several orders of magnitude between 0.006% and 0.6%. The probability of SLN-metastasis was found to be independent from tracer uptake in the lymph node. The radioactivity uptake of the SLNs in distinct lymph node regions showed no significant differences. CONCLUSION: The radiotracer is transferred out of the prostate via blood flow, by direct transfer via the urethra into the bladder and by lymphatic transport. Injecting a total activity of 200 MBq leads to a mean effective dose of 1.5 mSv. It is not recommended to use the tracer uptake in lymph nodes as the only criterion to characterize SLNs","","","","","","02020102 [pii]","Klinik fur Nuklearmedizin, Klinikum Augsburg, Deutschland. wengenmair.radiologie@augsburg-med.de","PM:11989296","","","",""

They represent potential therapeutic targets in prostate cancer. Lapatinib is an oral inhibitor of EGFR and HER-2. The objective of this study is to assess the preliminary clinical efficacy of lapatinib in the therapy of castration-resistant prostate cancer. METHODS:: In this multicenter, open-label trial, patients with rising PSA on androgen deprivation therapy and not having received chemotherapy were eligible. They were treated with lapatinib at a dose of 1,500 mg once daily. The primary end point was a >50% confirmed PSA decline from baseline; safety, tolerability, and time to PSA progression were secondary outcomes. RESULTS:: Twenty-nine patients enrolled in the study had a median age of 73 years and a baseline PSA of 21.6 ng/ml. Seven patients had no radiologic evidence of metastatic disease, while the remaining patients had bone or measurable disease or both. Treatment was well tolerated with only grade 3 treatment-related toxicities being diarrhea (14%) and rash (3%). One of 21 evaluable patients had >50% reduction in PSA, while another patient had 47% reduction in PSA with an ongoing duration of response of 45+ months. The median time to PSA progression was 29 days. CONCLUSIONS:: Lapatinib showed single agent activity in a small subset of unselected patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer, as measured by PSA. Future trials should explore a trial design with time-to-event end points and predictive biomarkers and a combination with other agents","","","","","","S1078-1439(10)00299-1 [pii];10.1016/j.urolonc.2010.09.018 [doi]","Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Medicine, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC 27599, USA; Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC 27599, USA","PM:21396844","","","",""

They also have a role in endometriosis, uterine fibroids and central precocious puberty. Areas covered in the review: Triptorelin embonate 22.5 mg is a new, sustained-release, 6-month formulation of an LH RH agonist. It possesses longer duration of action than the current standard 3-month preparation and appears to have similar efficacy and side effects. What the reader will gain: The use of LH RH agonists for androgen deprivation in prostate cancer has increased considerably in the last 20 years. Recent work has shown that some of this usage has constituted overtreatment and it is within these newer paradigms of therapy that the new 6-month preparation is situated. Take home message: The new 6-month LH RH preparation triptorelin embonate will be of help in several key areas of therapy for prostate cancer, notably as an adjunct to radiation therapy and chemotherapy. It possesses a similar effect, but with fewer side effects, than those that are now commonly available. (c) 2010 Informa UK, Ltd","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Three patient cases were selected (with disease in different anatomical areas): vertebral metastasis re-treatment, radical prostate therapy and an ethmoid sarcoma re-treatment. Each case presents significant and varying dosimetric difficulties with respect to avoidance of adjacent organs. The patients were each planned and treated at the Cromwell Hospital (London, UK) using the TomoTherapy HiArt system, with planning replicated at St Bartholomew's Hospital (London, UK) using Eclipse Treatment Planning System and a 6EX linac with a 120-leaf multileaf collimator (Varian Medical Systems). For both modalities, all treatment plans conformed to the stringent clinical dose constraints set. For the vertebral body re-treatment, both techniques demonstrated adequate and similar planning target volume (PTV) coverage and sparing of the spinal cord. The critical structure sparing and PTV coverage for the prostate treatment was again similar for both modalities. For re-treatment of the paediatric ethmoid sarcoma, tomotherapy was able to produce slightly better organ sparing whilst producing PTV coverage similar to linac dIMRT. The data presented in this manuscript demonstrate subtle dosimetric differences between the two techniques but no marked advantage with either system. Therefore, other factors may need to be considered when making a decision between tomotherapy and linac dIMRT","","","","","","81/964/333 [pii];10.1259/bjr/67084583 [doi]","Radiotherapy Physics, St Bartholomew's Hospital, West Smithfield, London EC1A 7BE, UK","PM:18344277","","","",""

Among the options, second-line hormonal therapy is commonly used. We investigated the efficacy of ketoconazole, an inhibitor of testicular and adrenal androgen biosynthesis, for treating patients with advanced hormone refractory prostate cancer. METHODS: The study comprised 38 patients with progressive disease despite combined androgen blockade. Treatment consisted of intermediate-dose ketoconazole (300mg three times daily) and replacement hydrocortisone. Patients were monitored clinically and with serial psa measurements every 3 months. the principal endpoint was psa response. RESULTS: Of the 38 patients, 21 (55.3%) showed a decrease in PSA >50% (95% confidence interval 38.3%-71.4%) with a median duration of 6 months (range 3-48 months). A PSA reduction >50% was seen in 21 of 34 patients (61.8%) with established metastases. Thirteen patients (34.2%), all of whom had metastases, exhibited a PSA decrease >80% (95% confidence interval 19.6%-51.4%) with a median duration of 9 months (range 3-48 months). Age, PSA at diagnosis, Gleason score and bone scan result were not significantly associated with response to ketoconazole treatment in univariate or multivariate analyses. For the entire study group, the median time to progression was 5 months (range 0-27 months) and the median survival was 12 months (range 3-48 months). Overall, 12 patients (31.6%) reported toxicity related to intermediate-dose ketoconazole but only 6 patients (15.8%) discontinued therapy due to intolerable side effects. CONCLUSION: It is apparent from this study that a reasonable percentage of patients failing standard hormonal therapy respond favourably to intermediate-dose ketoconazole and that toxicity is mild. In the absence of studies demonstrating better survival with chemotherapy, we believe that a trial of ketoconazole should be considered when progression occurs on hormone therapy","","","","","","10.1016/j.eururo.2003.11.031 [doi];S0302283803006778 [pii]","The Midwest Prostate and Urology Health Center, Weiss Memorial Hospital, 4646 North Marine Drive, Chicago, IL 60640, USA. simonmwilkinson@hotmail.com","PM:15082199","","","",""

Treatment goals for men with advanced prostate cancer include prolonging survival, preventing or delaying symptoms due to disease progression, improving and maintaining quality of life, reducing treatment related morbidity. Androgen suppression therapy is considered a mainstay of treatment for men with advanced prostate cancer. However it is not clear whether early androgen suppression for men with locally advanced disease or asymptomatic metastases improves length and quality of life compared to androgen suppression deferred until signs and symptoms of clinical progression. OBJECTIVES: This systematic review assessed the efficacy and adverse effects of primary therapy with early versus deferred androgen suppression therapy in men with advanced prostate cancer. SEARCH STRATEGY: Randomized controlled trials were searched in general and specialized databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CancerLIT, Cochrane Library, VA Cochrane Prostate Disease register) and by reviewing bibliographies including those of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association Technology Evaluation Center/Evidence-based Practice Center of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (BCBS/TEC-AHRQ) report No.4. SELECTION CRITERIA: All published randomized trials were eligible for inclusion provided they: randomized men with advanced prostate cancer to early versus deferred androgen suppression; reported overall, progression-free, and cancer-specific survival, and/or adverse events; did not utilize androgen suppression as adjuvant therapy to radiation treatment. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: An independent reviewer using a standardized form extracted information on trial characteristics, interventions, and outcomes. Results were reviewed for accuracy and discrepancies resolved by discussion. The main outcome measure for comparing effectiveness was the overall survival at 1, 2, 5 and 10 years. Progression-free survival, cancer-specific survival, complications due to disease progression and the incidence of adverse effects of treatment were also measured. MAIN RESULTS: Four trials involving 2167 patients were included in this review. All of the trials were conducted prior to use of prostate specific antigen (PSA) testing. There was variability between studies regarding the treatments used and the requirements for initiation of treatments. The percent overall survival at 1, 2, 5, and 10 years for the early treatment group was 88%, 73%, 44%, and 18%. For the deferred therapy group the percent overall survival was 86%, 71%, 37%, and 12%. The pooled estimate for the difference in overall survival favored early therapy but was significant only at 10 years when few patients had survived (OR=1.16 (95% CI: 0.90 to 1.49) at 1 year; OR=1.08 (95% CI: 0.89 to 1.33) at 2 years; OR=1.19 (95% CI: 0.95 to 1.50) at 5 years, and OR=1.50 (95% CI: 1.04 to 2.16) at 10 years). The pooled estimate of prostate cancer specific survival at 2, 5, and 10 years favored early therapy though the confidence intervals were wide and the results not statistically different. The risk differences at 2, 5, and 10 years were 2.7%, 5.8%, and 4.6%. Although each study used unique definitions of progression free survival, all studies found progression free survival was consistently better in the early intervention group at all time points. Complications due to disease progression were only reported in one study but were more frequent in the deferred treatment group. Adverse events due to treatment were also only reported in one study but occurred more frequently in the early treatment group. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The evidence from randomized controlled trials is limited by the variability in study design, stage of cancer and subjects enrolled, interventions utilized, definitions and reporting of outcomes and the lack of PSA testing for diagnostic and monitoring purposes. However, the available information suggests that early androgen suppression for treatment of advanced prostate cancer reduces disease progression and complications due to progression. Early androgen suppression may provide a small but statistically significant improvement in overall survival at 10 years. There was no statistically significant difference in prostate cancer specific survival but a clinically important difference could not be excluded. These outcomes need to be evaluated with the evidence suggesting higher costs and more frequent treatment related adverse effects with early therapy. Additional studies are required to evaluate more definitively the efficacy and adverse effects of early versus delayed androgen suppression in men with prostate cancer. In particular trials should evaluate patients with advanced prostate cancer diagnosed by PSA testing and men with persistent or rising PSA levels following treatment options (e.g. radical prostatectomy, radiation therapy or observation) for clinically localized disease. STARTING ANDROGEN SUPPRESSION (HORMONE) THERAPY EARLY, BEFORE ADVANCED PROSTATE CANCER STARTS PROGRESSING MAY IMPROVE CHANCES OF LONGER SURVIVAL.: The prostate gland is part of the male sex gland and is a common site of cancer in older men. Treatments for prostate cancer include surgery and radiation therapy. Male hormones (androgens) stimulate prostate cancer growth. Hormone suppression therapy, decreasing the levels of these hormones, is therefore also used to try to treat prostate cancer. It is not clear however whether it is better to start hormone treatment straight after diagnosis, or to wait until the disease progresses. The review found that early hormone suppression treatment decreased the progression of advanced prostate cancer and improved survival. Further studies are needed","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The surrogate role of markers of disease progression (haemoglobin and prostate specific (PSA) antigen levels; number of bone scan-positive sites), symptomatic factors (analgesic intake; number of painful bone sites) and history of prior external radiotherapy, were analysed to determine whether any parameters had a predictive effect on the success of strontium-89 treatment. The success of strontium-89 injection was determined by calculating the change in number of sites of bone pain (pain sites) and analgesic intake. The outcome was classed as successful in 42 (56.0%) patients, unsuccessful in 13 (17.3%) and unchanged in 20 (26.7%). Proportionately more of the patients who had 'superscans' on bone scintigraphy at baseline had an unsuccessful outcome after a strontium-89 injection (5/7; 71.4%); for those with fewer bone scan-positive sites the majority had successful outcomes. Patients with a successful outcome had a significantly better survival rate after strontium-89 injection. Multivariate analysis showed haemoglobin level, PSA level and outcome after strontium-89 treatment to be significant independent prognostic variables; no change/unsuccessful outcome, a high PSA level prior to treatment, and a low haemoglobin level were associated with poor survival. It is suggested that early treatment with strontium-89 (Metastron) in patients with fewer bone metastases is more likely to be successful, with a longer time before further therapy required","","","","","","","Department of Radiotherapy and Oncology, Ninewells Hospital and Medical School, Dundee, UK","PM:11527299","","","",""

A total of 8113 men with localised or locally advanced prostate cancer and negative bone scans were recruited. Patients were randomised to receive either bicalutamide 150 mg per day (n = 4052) or placebo (n = 4061) once daily, in addition to standard care. The primary endpoints for the programme are time to objectively confirmed progression and overall survival. Secondary endpoints include time to doubling of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and tolerability. The tolerability profile of bicalutamide 150 mg was closely related to its pharmacology, with gynaecomastia (66%) and breast pain (73%) the most frequently reported adverse events. The majority of the gynaecomastia (70%) and breast pain (90%) events improved or resolved following withdrawal from therapy. Bicalutamide 150 mg significantly reduced the risk of objective progression by 42% (p (much less than) 0.0001) compared with standard care alone. This effect was seen in patients with localised disease (28% reduction; p < 0.001) and locally advanced disease (54% reduction; p < 0.001), and was also seen regardless of the type of standard care received. In addition, bicalutamide 150 mg plus standard care reduced the risk of PSA doubling by 59% (p (much less than) 0.0001), and the incidence of bone metastases by 33% (p < 0.0001), compared with patients receiving placebo plus standard care. After a median follow-up of 3 years, there was no significant difference in overall survival between the treatment groups (p = 0.43); however, both progression and survival continue to be followed in these ongoing studies. In conclusion, immediate bicalutamide 150 mg treatment, either alone or as an adjuvant to treatment of curative intent, significantly reduces the risk of disease progression in patients with localised or locally advanced prostate cancer.

METHODS: We have prospectively included 34 patients with breast (N=24) or prostate cancer (N=10) at high risk of BMs. Whole-body PET/CT (low-dose CT) and bone scintigraphy (BS) with single photon emission CT were obtained for all 34 patients and the results compared with a radiological gold standard. RESULTS: Out of the 386 foci detected by PET/CT, 219 (56.7%) could be verified by CT or MRI. Eighty-six additional foci were detected by BS (n=46) or seen only by CT (n=9), MRI (n=23), or both CT and MRI (n=8). The total number of verified lesions was therefore 274 (58.1%), including 119 (43.4%) benign and 155 (56.6%) BM. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of (1)F-fluoride PET/CT were 76, 84.2, and 80%, respectively. For BS, they were 44.8, 79.2, and 60%, respectively. Sensitivity significantly decreased for the lytic lesions. The accuracy of PET/CT was significantly superior to BS for pelvic and lumbar lesions. PET/CT provided a correct diagnosis (M+/M0) in 32 of 33 patients (one false positive) compared with 28 of 33 with BS (four false positive, one false positive). CONCLUSION: (1)F-fluoride PET/CT is significantly more accurate than BS for detecting BMs from breast and prostate cancers","","","","","","10.1097/MNM.0b013e3283412ef5 [doi]","University of Liege, Belgium","PM:21076343","","","",""

However, the role of bisphosphonates in pain relief for bony metastases remains uncertain. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness of bisphosphonates for the relief of pain from bone metastases. SEARCH STRATEGY: MEDLINE (1966 to 1999), EMBASE (1980 to 1999), CancerLit (1966 to 1999), T he Cochrane L ibrary (Issue 1, 2000) and the Oxford Pain Database were searched using the strategy devised by the Cochrane Pain, Palliative and Supportive Care Group with additional terms 'diphosphonate', 'bisphosphonate', 'multiple myeloma' and 'bone neoplasms'. (Last search: January 2000). SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized trials of bisphosphonates compared with open, blinded, or different doses/types of bisphosphonates in cancer patients were included where pain and/or analgesic consumption were outcome measures. Studies where pain was reported only by observers were excluded. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Article eligibility, quality assessment and data extraction were undertaken by both review authors. The proportions of patients with pain relief at 4, 8 and 12 weeks were assessed. The proportion of patients with analgesic reduction, the mean pain score, mean analgesic consumption, adverse drug reactions, and quality of life data were compared as secondary outcomes. MAIN RESULTS: Thirty randomized controlled studies (21 blinded, four open and five active control) with a total of 3682 subjects were included. For each outcome, there were few studies with available data. For the proportion of patients with pain relief (eight studies) pooled data showed benefits for the treatment group, with an NNT at 4 weeks of 11[95% CI 6-36] and at 12 weeks of 7 [95% CI 5-12]. In terms of adverse drug reactions, the NNH was 16 [95% CI 12-27] for discontinuation of therapy. Nausea and vomiting were reported in 24 studies with a non-significant trend for greater risk in the treatment group. One study showed a small improvement in quality of life for the treatment group at 4 weeks. The small number of studies in each subgroup with relevant data limited our ability to explore the most effective bisphosphonates and their relative effectiveness for different primary neoplasms. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is evidence to support the effectiveness of bisphosphonates in providing some pain relief for bone metastases. There is insufficient evidence to recommend bisphosphonates for immediate effect; as first line therapy; to define the most effective bisphosphonates or their relative effectiveness for different primary neoplasms. Bisphosphonates should be considered where analgesics and/or radiotherapy are inadequate for the management of painful bone metastases. BISPHOSPHONATES FOR THE RELIEF OF PAIN SECONDARY TO BONE METASTASES: Bisphosphonates give some relief from pain caused by cancer that has invaded bones. Patients with cancer that has spread to the bone frequently have pain. Pain control is an important part of cancer management. Bisphosphonates are medicines that affect the way bone develops, and are proving useful in treating patients with cancer that has invaded the bone (metastasis). This review looked at the effect of bisphosphonates on pain caused by bone metastases. Bisphosphonates do have some effect but are not as useful as either strong analgesics (such as morphine) or radiotherapy. However, where other methods of pain relief are inadequate, the addition of bisphosphonates can be beneficial. Bisphosphonates can cause nausea and vomiting","","","","","","","","","","","",""

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Median patient age was 68 years. Local relapse after external beam irradiation was confirmed by biopsy. Median prostate specific antigen at local relapse was 4.7 ng/ml. Five of the 17 patients were enrolled in a protocol combining androgen deprivation therapy with brachytherapy and the remaining men were treated off protocol. All patients received neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy for a median of 3 months, followed by ultrasound guided brachytherapy using 125I in 9 and 103Pd seeds in 8. Five patients also received adjuvant leuprolide for a median of 6 months. Biochemical failure was defined using the American Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology definition. Toxicity was graded with a modified Radiation Therapy Oncology Group scale. RESULTS: Median followup was 44 months. The actuarial 4-year biochemical control rate was 75%. Three patients died of intercurrent diseases. No prostate cancer mortality or local failure had occurred at last followup. One patient had bone metastasis. No clinical or treatment factor was associated with biochemical control. Grade 3 and 4 genitourinary toxicity developed in 7 (41%) and 1 patients (6%), respectively. Grade 2 and 3 gastrointestinal toxicity occurred in 5 (29%) and 1 patients (6%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our series suggests that salvage brachytherapy and short-term androgen deprivation therapy can achieve biochemical control in select patients with local relapse after prior external beam irradiation. The major side effects are urinary complications, including grade 3 and 4 complications in 41% and 6% of cases, respectively","","","","","","S0022-5347(06)01725-3 [pii];10.1016/j.juro.2006.07.008 [doi]","Departments of Radiation Oncology, Mayo Clinic Arizona, Scottsdale, Arizona 85259, USA. wong.william@mayo.edu","PM:17070243","","","",""

Metastatic bone disease can have significant impact on morbidity and mortality of cancer patients. Skeletal-morbidity (spinal cord compression, hypercalcaemia, fracture, need for radiotherapy and surgery to bone) can be effectively reduced by bisphosphonates, a class of anti-resorptive drugs. They are also effective in relieving pain from bone metastases, and may improve survival in patients with accelerated bone resorption. Additionally, there is an exciting body of evidence that suggest these drugs may have anti-tumor effects that may be exploited to prevent or delay the development of bone metastases. Reported effects include inhibition of cancer cell migration, adhesion and invasion as well as anti-angiogenic and immunomodulating effects. The pre-clinical evidence is compelling, and some recently reported randomised clinical studies go part way to support their use in clinical practice at earlier stages of the disease to prevent bone metastases. However, further results are awaited before routine clinical use in the adjuvant setting can be recommended","","","","","","BSP/CPD/E-Pub/000202 [pii]","Academic Unit of Clinical Oncology, Weston Park Hospital, Sheffield, UK","PM:20722624","","","",""

Expert opinion on the effectiveness of bisphosphonates in this setting is evolving. Here we review current evidence on the risks and benefits of bisphosphonate therapy for a wide variety of cancers, as well as clinical management of its adverse effects. A MEDLINE search of English-language literature (1966 through May 2006) was conducted using the terms bisphosphonate, cancer, multiple myeloma, malignancy, and randomized controlled clinical studies. Studies were selected based on clinical pertinence, with an emphasis on phase III clinical trials. We reviewed bibliographies for other relevant articles. Accumulating evidence reveals that bisphosphonate therapy has a significant effect in preventing skeletal complications in multiple myeloma, breast cancers, and prostate cancer, and in reducing skeletal complications in other metastatic bone malignancies. Emerging data indicate that bisphosphonates are useful for preventing bone loss resulting from cancer or its therapy. The efficacy of bisphosphonates for early-stage breast cancers remains controversial. Significant risks of bisphosphonate therapy include nephrotoxicity, electrolyte abnormalities, and osteonecrosis of the jaw. Bisphosphonate therapy has a clear role in the management of skeletal metastases associated with a variety of cancers. However, significant side effects require ongoing monitoring and treatment","","","","","","779468969 [pii];10.1080/02841860701233435 [doi]","Medical Oncology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA","PM:17562434","","","",""

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Bone is the most common metastatic site in patients with AIPC and the only site of metastatic disease for many; because some with initial bone metastasis eventually develop soft-tissue disease, many clinical trials use routine CT to monitor for the latter as a sign of disease progression, but the actual incidence of new soft-tissue metastases is unknown and the role of routine interval CT in monitoring for disease progression, especially for asymptomatic patients, is unclear. Thus we reviewed 175 cases of metastatic AIPC from three randomized phase II clinical trials (docetaxel/thalidomide, docetaxel/vaccine, and ketoconazole/alendronate) at the National Cancer Institute between 1995 and 2004. The patients' PSA levels were assessed every 4 weeks, and CT and bone scans were done every 2-3 months. We retrospectively identified patients with bone metastasis only and examined subsequent CT for the occurrence of soft-tissue disease. For patients with progressive disease, we also examined bone scan and PSA progression. RESULTS: Of 175 patients with metastatic prostate cancer, 105 (60%) had bone metastasis only, 12 (6.9%) had soft-tissue metastases only, and 58 (33.1%) had both bone and soft-tissue metastases. The median (range) follow-up was 8 (1-44) months for the 105 patients with bone metastasis only. During that time, two patients (1.9%) developed new soft-tissue disease; one developed right iliac fossa lymphadenopathy after 8 months and the other developed a perirectal mass after 12 months. The patient with new lymphadenopathy also had multiple new bone lesions identified by bone scan and PSA progression. The patient with the perirectal mass had PSA progression and a palpable abnormality. CONCLUSION: This review of patients with AIPC and bone metastasis only, followed for a median of 8 months on clinical trials, shows that the incidence of asymptomatic new soft-tissue disease as the only sign of disease progression is quite low. Therefore, routine CT to exclude new soft-tissue disease in this population appears to be unwarranted. We recommend that for these patients CT is done only at the time of disease progression, as shown by bone scan, PSA level, or clinical presentation. We do not exclude the possibility that patients who remain on trial for significantly longer periods might benefit from routine interval CT","","","","","","BJU6654 [pii];10.1111/j.1464-410X.2006.06654.x [doi]","Medical Oncology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute/NIH, 10 Center Drive, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA","PM:17155971","","","",""

Higher prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and alkaline phosphatase (ALK-P) levels predicted worse survival in men with metastatic hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC). In the current study, the authors evaluated the combined effects of PSA and ALK-P on survival. METHODS. Two hundred twenty-four men who had HRPC with bone metastases and who were receiving chemotherapy were identified, and 143 of those men had data available on both ALK-P and PSA levels at chemotherapy initiation. The primary endpoint of the study was overall survival (OS) after chemotherapy. The men were dichotomized into normal and abnormal ALK-P groups according to levels based on inst itutional normal ranges. The effect of PSA was evaluated as both a categorical value and a continuous value using Cox regression. RESULTS. Eighty-nine of 143 patients (62%) had elevated ALK-P levels. The median PSA was 147 ng/mL (93 ng/mL in patients with normal ALK-R 171 ng/mL in patients with elevated ALK-P). At a median follow-up of 30 months after chemotherapy initiation, 93 patients had died. The median OS after chemotherapy was 15.8 months (95% confidence interval, 12.8-18.4 months) and was significantly longer if ALK-P was in the normal range (21.3 months vs 14 months; P = .005). For the group with normal ALK-P levels, the median OS was 12.5 months, 24.5 months, and 36.9 months for patients with low, medium, and high PSA levels, resp ectively. In contrast, the effect of PSA on survival was not as evident in the group with elevated ALK-P levels (16.5 months vs 11.9 months vs 12.1 months, respectively; P =.14 for interaction). Age-adjusted multivariate analysis demonstrated statistically significant interactions of PSA and ALK-P with OS (P = .02). CONCLUSIONS. ALK-P significantly predicted OS in men with HRPC who had bone metastases. In patients with normal ALK-P levels, higher PSA levels were associated with improved survival.

Patients were managed expectantly as long as they did not meet the empirically predefined criteria of clinical, histological or PSA progression. Bone scint igraphy was repeated every year for the first 2 years, then every 2 years thereafter if the patient remained on watchful observation. When the follow-up PSA level was > 15 ng/mL the patient underwent bone scintigraphy every year. RESULTS: In all, 244 eligible patients were enrolled into the study. With a median follow-up of 30 months, 449 bone scans were taken (150 at baseline and 299 in follow-up evaluations); all 299 follow-up scans were negative for bone metastasis. Hence, the true rate of positive follow-up bone scans was estimated to be 0-1.0% (95% confidence). In all, 171 patients had at least one follow-up bone scan; of these, the number (%) of patients who had 1, 2, 3, 4 and >= 5 follow-up scans was 89 (52), 53 (31), 17 (10), eight (4.7) and four (2.3), respectively. The PSA levels (ng/mL) corresponding to all follow-up bone scans were: 214 scans at PSA < 10, 61 at 10-14.9, 18 at 15-19.9 and six at >=20 (range 20.2-24.9). The probability of a negative bone scan was estimated to be 88-100% (95% confidence interval) when a PSA threshold of 15 ng/mL was used. CONCLUSION: The probability of positive findings in serial bone scans in untreated, localized, low to intermediate grade prostate cancer was low when the follow-up PSA level remained < 15 ng/mL. Avoiding bone scans in this group of patients would translate into a significant cost saving and reduction in their psychological and physical burden. As for those with a follow-up PSA of > 15 ng/mL, the role of serial bone scintigraphy remains undefined, as a longer follow-up and a larger sample are needed","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We investigated the significance of skeletal muscle involvement by cancer in needle biopsies in predicting adverse outcomes at radical prostatectomy. Materials and Methods From 2000 to 2009, we retrospectively identified 40 cases with Gleason score 6 adenocarcinoma involving up to 20% of 1 core, with skeletal muscle involvement. Outcomes of radical prostatectomy were compared with a control group of 82 cases with the same parameters without skeletal muscle involvement from the same period. Results In radical prostatectomy specimens Gleason score greater than 6, extraprostatic extension and positive margins were found in 15.0%, 7.5% and 12.5% of patients in the study group, compared to 20.7%, 11.0% and 4.9% of patients in the control group, respectively. No statistically significant differences were found between cases with or without skeletal muscle involvement on needle biopsy. The apical margin was the only positive margin in 4 of 5 study group cases with positive margins. In contrast, positive margins were randomly distributed in the control group. Conclusions Limited cancer involvement of skeletal muscle in biopsy specimens should not be used as a contraindication for radical prostatectomy for otherwise resectable prostate cancer as most patients have organ confined disease and negative margins. However, care must be taken during division of the dorsal vein complex to avoid a positive margin on the anterior apex of the prostate.

Methods: Overall 26 prostate cancer patients with ADT were given zoledronic acid 4mg by a 15-min i.v. infusion every 3months for up to 12months. Assessment was made at baseline and at 3, 6, 9 and 12months. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry was used to measure the BMD of the lumbar spine and the femoral neck at baseline and 12months. Results: A total of 23 of 26 recruited patients completed the study. Seven patients had bone metastases. The overall mean increase in BMD (T-score) of the lumbar spine and femoral head from baseline to follow up at 12months was significant (-2.32+/-0.98 to -2.03+/-1.08, P=0.02 and -1.77+/-0.72 to -1.63+/-0.76, P=0.01, respectively). In subgroup analyses, significant BMD improvement was observed independent of the status of bone metastasis and the means of ADT. Zoledronic acid had no adverse effect on renal function. Adverse events related to zoledronic acid were minimal. Conclusion: Zoledronic acid administered every 3months significantly increased BMD in prostate cancer patients receiving ADT. It had a satisfactory adverse event profile and imposed minimal risk on patients' renal function. (c) 2011 Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods and Materials: This report is based on an interim analysis of the first 120 consecutive patients in this Phase III trial after a median follow-up of 43.5 months (range 23-62). RT planning was based on two-dimensional CT data, and the treatment was delivered using a three- or four-field 6-23-MV photon technique. GI and urogen ital toxicity (symptom questionnaires incorporating the subjective elements of the late effects of normal tissues - subjective, objective, management, analytic classification of late effects and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer sexual function questionnaire) were evaluated before RT and 1 month, 1 year, and 2 years after RT completion. The efficacy of RT was assessed clinically (digital rectal examination and radiologic imaging) and biochemically (prostate-specific antigen assay) at baseline, and every 3 months for 2 years after RT and every 6 months subsequently. Results: RT, whether conventional or hypofractionated, resulted in an increase in all six symptom categories used to characterize GI toxicity and in four of five symptom categories used to document urinary morbidity 1 month after therapy completion. Sexual dysfunction (based on limited data), which existed in more than one-third of patients before RT, also increased to just more than one-half of patients 1 month after RT. The increase in urinary toxicity after RT was not sustained (diurnal urinary frequency had decreased significantly at 2 years). In contrast, all six symptom categories of GI toxicity remained increased 1 year after RT. Four of the six GI symptom categories (rectal pain, mucous discharge, urgency of defecation, and rectal bleeding) were still increased at 2 years compared with baseline. Except for a slightly greater percentage of patients experiencing mild rectal bleeding at 2 years among those who received hypofractionated RT, no differences were noted in toxicity between the conventional and hypofractionated RT schedule. The mean prostate-specific antigen level was 14.0 +/- 1.0 ng/mL at baseline and declined to a nadir of 1.3 +/- 0.2 ng/mL at a median of 16.8 months (range 0.8-28.3) after RT completion. However, it then rose in 17 pati ents (8 in the hypofractionated and 9 in the conventional treatment group). Only 8 of these 17 patients were found to have signs of clinical relapse (5 local, 1 regional lymph node, and 2 systemic [bony metastases]) after histopathologic and radiologic reassessment). The remaining 9 patients had biochemical relapse only (defined as three consecutive rises in prostate-specific antigen after nadir). The 4-year biochemical relapse-free survival rate was 85.8% for all patients and did not differ significantly between the two radiation dose schedules (86.2% for the hypofractionated and 85.5% for the conventional fractionation group). Conclusion: RT for prostate carcinoma, using a three- or four-field 6-23-MV photon technique without posterior shielding of the lateral fields, is an underestimated cause of persistent GI morbidity. The incidence of clinically significant GI and urogenital toxicity after conventional and hypofractionated RT appears to be similar. Hypofractionated RT for carcinoma of the prostate seems just as effective as conventional RT after a median follow-up approaching 4 years.

METHODS: Five hundred eleven patients with urological cancer and documented bone metastases treated from January 2003 to April 2008 in ten Japanese institutions were included in a retrospective analysis. Type and incidence of SRE (fracture, radiotherapy, spinal cord compression, surgery, hypercalcemia, and bone pain) were determined from patient medical records. RESULTS: The overall incidence of SRE, including 'pain', was 61%. The most common event was radiotherapy for bone metastases, with an incidence of 31%. The overall incidence of events seemed to be similar among Japanese and Western patients with prostate cancer and renal cell carcinoma when comparing data with previously published reports. Nevertheless, a much lower incidence of fracture (19.1%) was observed in Japanese renal cell carcinoma patients. CONCLUSIONS: The overall incidence of SRE in Japanese urological cancer patients with bone metastasis was similar to that in Western patients, but the incidence of fracture was lower in Japanese renal cancer patients","","","","","","IJU2468 [pii];10.1111/j.1442-2042.2010.02468.x [doi]","Department of Urology, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan. yokoa@uro.med.kyushu-u.ac.jp","PM:20202004","","","",""

high risk of recurrence despite local therapy. Although hormonal therapy has palliative benefit for the majority of patients with metastatic disease, randomized trials have not demonstrated a survival benefit for its administration prior to surgery for locally advanced disease. Historically, chemotherapy has been felt to have little activity in hormone-refractory prostate cancer, but new evidence may refute this belief. Ongoing clinical trials are now investigating the use of chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting. We review the recent literature regarding the use of neoadjuvant hormonal manipulation, chemotherapy, and promising new molecular targeted agents in patients with high-risk localized prostate cancer.

This phase II study investigated the activity of dasatinib in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Chemotherapy-naive men with CRPC and increasing prostate-specific antigen were treated with dasatinib 100 or 70 mg twice daily. Endpoints included changes in prostate-specific antigen, bone scans, measurable disease (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor), and markers of bone metabolism. Following Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 guidelines, lack of progression according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor and bone scan was determined and reported at 12 and 24 weeks. RESULTS: Forty-seven patients were enrolled and received dasatinib (initial dose 100 mg twice daily, n = 25; 70 mg twice daily, n = 22), of whom 41 (87%) had bone disease. Lack of progression was achieved in 20 (43%) patients at week 12 and in 9 (19%) patients at week 24. Of 41 evaluable patients, 21 (51%) patients achieved > or =40% reduction in urinary N-telopeptide by week 12, with 33 (80%) achieving some level of reduction anytime on study. Of 15 patients with elevated urinary N-telopeptide at baseline, 8 (53%) normalized on study. Of 40 evaluable patients, 24 (60%) had reduction in bone alkaline phosphatase at week 12 and 25 (63%) achieved some reduction on study. Dasatinib was generally well tolerated and treatment-related adverse events were moderate. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides encouraging evidence of dasatinib activity in bone and reasonable tolerability in chemotherapy-naive patients with metastatic CRPC","","","","","","1078-0432.CCR-09-1691 [pii];10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-09-1691 [doi]","University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA","PM:19920114","","","",""

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Men with >/=3 prostate cancer bone metastases identified by Tc-99m methylene diphosphonate (MDP) bone scintigraphy and/or computed tomography were enrolled in a prospective study of serial acetate and FDG PET imaging. Patients were imaged before and 6 to 12 weeks after initial androgen deprivation therapy for new metastatic prostate cancer or first-line chemotherapy with docetaxel for castration-resistant prostate cancer. Qualitative assessment and changes in the tumor:normal uptake ratio were used to assess response by both acetate and FDG PET. In addition, the detection of bone metastases pretherapy was compared for acetate and FDG PET. RESULTS: A total of 8 patients with documented bone metastases were imaged, of which 6 were imaged both pre- and post-therapy. Acetate PET detected bone metastases in all 8 patients, whereas FDG PET detected lesions in 6 of the 7 imaged patients. Acetate PET generally detected more metastases with a higher tumor:normal uptake ratio. Qualitative and quantitative assessments of post-treatment response correlated with composite clinical designations of response, stable disease, or progression in 6 of 6 and 5 of 6 by acetate and 4 of 5 and 3 of 5 by FDG PET, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In this pilot study, results indicate that acetate PET holds promise for response assessment of prostate cancer bone metastases and is complementary to FDG PET in bone metastasis detection","","","","","","10.1097/RLU.0b013e318208f140 [doi];00003072-201103000-00005 [pii]","Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Washington and Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98109, USA. evanyu@uw.edu","PM:21285676","","","",""

It is characterized by its propensity for bone metastases which occur in more than 80% of patients with advanced disease. Patients are at risk of complications including pain, hypercalcaemia, bone fracture and spinal cord compression. Hormonal treatment is the mainstay of treatment for these patients but most of them will then become hormone refractory. Bisphosphonates act by inhibiting osteoclast activities and are a potential therapeutic option for metastatic prostate cancer. In addition, they have been shown to reduce pain in patients with bone metastases as a consequence of multiple myeloma. Early uncontrolled studies of bisphosphonates in metastatic prostate cancer patients have shown encouraging results. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this review was to determine the effectiveness of bisphosphonates in relieving pain in patients with bone metastases from prostate cancer. SEARCH STRATEGY: Studies were identified by electronic search of bibliographic databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE, CancerLit and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register. Handsearching included Proceedings of American Society of Clinical Oncology and reference lists of all eligible trials identified. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled studies comparing the effectiveness of bisphosphonates with placebo or open control for pain relief in patients with bone metastases from prostate cancer. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data were extracted from eligible studies and included study design, participants, interventions and outcomes. Comparable data were pooled together for meta-analysis with intention-to-treat principle. Outcomes included pain response, analgesic consumption, skeletal events (including pathological fractures, spinal cord compression, bone radiotherapy, bone surgery), prostate cancer death, disease progression, radiological response, PSA response, adverse events, performance status, quality of life and comparisons between different routes, doses and types of bisphosphonates. MAIN RESULTS: One thousand nine hundred and fifty-five patients from ten studies were included in this review. The pain response rates were 27.9% and 21.1% for the treatment group and the control group, respectively, with an absolute risk difference of 6.8%. The OR for pain response was 1.54 (95% CI 0.97 to 2.44, P = 0.07), showing a trend of improved pain relief in the bisphosphonate group, although this was not statistically significant. The rates for skeletal events were 37.8% and 43.0% for the treatment group and the control group, respectively, with an absolute risk difference of 5.2%. The OR for skeletal events was 0.79 (95% CI 0.62 to 1.00, P = 0.05). A significant increase in nausea was observed in patients who received bisphosphonates compared to placebo. No increase in other adverse events was observed. There was no statistically significant difference between the bisphosphonate group and the control group in terms of prostate cancer death, disease progression, radiological response and PSA response. There are insufficient data to guide the choice of bisphosphonates or the dose and the route of administration . AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Bisphosphonates should be considered for patients with metastatic prostate cancer for the treatment of refractory bone pain and prevention of skeletal events. More research is needed to guide the choice of bisphosphonates, optimal treatment schedule as well as cost-benefit comparisons. Combining results from different studies is difficult because different tools were used to assess pain, and also, bisphosphonates vary considerably in potency. This review highlights the need for standardisation and co-ordination among researchers in cancer pain studies","","","","","","10.1002/14651858.CD006250 [doi]","University of Hong Kong, Centre of Infection, Hong Kong, China. kyyuen@hkucc.hku.hk","PM:17054286","","","",""

METHODS: Included in the study were 36 men with prostate cancer, suffering from painful osseous metastases and treated with (186)Re-HEDP. None had received any treatment that would have interfered with bone metabolism before (186)Re-HEDP treatment or throughout the follow-up period. For each patient, pretreatment and posttreatment serum levels of osteocalcin (OC), bone alkaline phosphatase (BALP), aminoterminal (PINP) and carboxyterminal (PICP) propeptides of type I collagen, amino-terminal (NTx) and carboxyterminal (CTx) telopeptides of type I collagen and their combinations were compared with the level and duration of pain response to radionuclide treatment. RESULTS: Pain response was correlated only with pretreatment NuTaux/PINP, PICP/PINP and NTx/CTx ratios and posttreatment decrease in baseline NTx and PICP values (p = 0.0025-0.035). According to multivariate and ROC analyses, the best marker-derived predictors of better and longer duration of response to (186)Re-HEDP treatment were a posttreatment decrease in NTx of > or = 20% (RR = 3.44, p = 0.0005) and a pretreatment NTx/PINP ratio of > or = 1.2 (RR = 3.04, p = 0.036) CONCLUSION: NTx, a potent collagenous marker of bone resorption, along with the novel NTx/PINP ratio provide useful cut-off values for identifying a group of patients suffering from painful osseous metastases from hormone-refractory prostatic carcinoma who do not respond to palliative treatment with (186)Re-HEDP. This information could help avoid an inefficient and expensive radionuclide treatment. Also, in the cohort of patients who will eventually undergo such treatment, the medium-term posttreatment changes in NTx offer valuable predictive information regarding long-term palliative response","","","","","","10.1007/s00259-009-1243-5 [doi]","Department of Nuclear Medicine, 401 Army Hospital of Athens, Mesogeion & Kanellopoulou 1, 11525, Athens, Greece, epiphany@in.gr","PM:19662405","","","",""

Signifcant alterations take place in the microenvironment of bone, which disturb the normal coupling that exists between bone resorption and bone formation. Consequently, a better understanding of the mechanisms that interact at the molecular level will defnitely result in more effective therapy for patients with this devastating complication of prostatic carcinoma. This review will discuss the diagnostic and predictive implications of various collagenous and non-collagenous bone markers, along with the novel markers of osteoclastogenesis and other matrix enzymes such as metalloproteinases and growth factors responsible for the complex biochemical mechanisms that upregulate bone resorption/formation during the development of metastasis. Further prospective studies are needed to determine whether any of these markers measured longitudinally in prostate cancer patients without bone scan evidence of skeletal disease will ultimately predict those patients who will develop bone metastases from their malignancy. Nonetheless, from the clinical point of view it is important to know that these novel mar kers carry the potential to provide meaningful information for daily practice by using upper normal reference values as cut-offs for identifying patients with an increased risk of developing progressive bone disease or skeletal related events","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of zoledronic acid on SREs in patients with bone metastases from bladder cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with bone metastases from bladder cancer who were receiving palliative radiotherapy were randomized to placebo or zoledronic acid (4 mg intravenous monthly) for 6 months. RESULTS: The patients (n = 40) were evenly distributed between the two treatment groups, and the baseline demographics of the two groups were similar. The follow-up varied from 8 to 65 weeks (median 24 weeks). Compared with patients receiving placebo, those receiving zoledronic acid had a lower mean incidence of SREs (2.05 +/- 1.0 vs. 0.95 +/- 0.9, respectively), and a larger proportion did not experience an on-study SRE (2 vs. 8 patients, respectively). Zoledronic acid also prolonged the median time to first SRE compared with the placebo (16 vs. 8 weeks, respectively). Multiple event analysis of SREs revealed that zoledronic acid decreased the risk of SRE development by 59% (hazard ratio 0.413). Zoledronic acid also increased the 1-year survival rate compared with placebo (36.3 +/- 11.2 vs. 0%, respectively). Zoledronic acid was generally well tolerated in our patient population. CONCLUSIONS: Zoledronic acid therapy decreased the incidence of SREs and improved the 1-year survival rate of patients with bone metastases from bladder cancer, potentially through its anticancer activity","","","","","","10.1007/s10147-010-0074-5 [doi]","Radiation Oncology Department, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt. mszagh@yahoo.com","PM:20354750","","","",""

The purpose of this article was to evaluate the pharmacoeconomics of available treatments for metastatic prostate cancer, including hormone-sensitive disease, androgen-independent prostate cancer and locally advanced/progressive disease. We identified 58 articles addressing economic issues related to metastatic prostate cancer. Treatment alternatives with considerably different costs are available in many areas of disease management, most notably, medical androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) versus surgical castration; combined androgen blockage (CAB) versus monotherapy for initial treatment of hormone-sensitive disease; as well as bisphosphonates and bone-targeted radioisotopes for palliation. The few available pharmacoeconomic studies indicate that the additional costs are not supported by clear and compelling evidence of differences in survival or quality-of-life (QOL) outcomes. Our review revealed that authors often use considerably different assumptions about efficacy and survival outcomes in their analyses, which may be due to the inconsistency of available clinical evidence. Although there have been many clinical trials comparing various therapies, we identified only three trials that included economic assessments. Thus, few sources of economic data are available and most pharmacoeconomic studies rely on information mined from indirect sources. We note that, while there has been considerable enthusiasm about the role of docetaxel regimens in the past 2 years, no study has yet examined the costs of these therapies. Survival remains poor for metastatic disease, thus QOL is the primary consideration for many therapies. However, QOL for treatment of metastatic disease is poorly measured and, in most analyses, the impact of therapy on QOL was inferred based on speculation by the authors. Given the large cost burdens of these treatments, it is essential that we more fully understand the true QOL gains potentially offered by more expensive therapies. The economic studies of advanced prostate cancer highlight several aspects of clinical care that are filled with considerable uncertainty and remain guided by forces other than optimal resource allocation. It is essential that we address the weaknesses in our understanding of the economic consequences of therapies for prostate cancer, and find ways to include economic information into the process of determining optimal therapy","","","","","","2544 [pii]","Division of Public Health Sciences, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington, USA","PM:17402804","","","",""

METHODS: We isolated cells from surgical resections of 21 prostate tumors and measured apoptosis and viability in these primary cells and 17 established cell lines from human prostate, bladder, renal cell and testicular carcinomas. RESULTS: We found that dexamethasone induces resistance regarding exposure to several cytotoxic agents such as taxol, gemcitabine, cisplatin, 5-FU and gamma-irradiation in 86% of the freshly isolated prostate tumors and in 100% of the established urological cell lines. No difference in dexamethasone-mediated protection was found in normal, benign and malignant prostate tumors.

Serum PSA level, relief of bone pain, myelosuppression, and vomiting were recorded and calculated. RESULTS: Docetaxel plus prednisone was administered to 44 patients: 13.6% (6/44) of them achieved complete response, 29.5% (13/44) partial response, 29.5% (13/44) had stable disease, and 27.3% (12/44) had disease progression. The average time to PSA progression was 37.8 weeks (12-101 weeks) in the response and stable disease patients. The 12 patients with disease progression were given MP as salvage therapy, and 16.7% (2/12) achieved a partial response, 25.0% (3/12) had stable disease and formed the new baseline. Only 2 patients died of disease aggravation. Mitoxantrone plus prednisone were given to 39 patients, and 7.7% (3/39) of them achieved complete response, 25.6% (10/39) partial response, 25.6% (10/39) had a stable disease, and 41.0% (16/39) of patients had disease progression. The mean time to PSA progression was 25.3 weeks (8-61 weeks) in the response and stable disease patients. The 14 patients with disease progression were administered DP as a salvage therapy and 7.1% (1/14) achieved complete response, 35.7% (5/14) partial response, and 21.4% (3/14) had stable disease and formed the new baseline. Four patients had died at the last follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: In Chinese patients, docetaxel plus prednisone is better than mitoxantrone plus prednisone in PSA response rate and PSA control, but has a bit more toxicity.

Such poor progress results from the biological basis of the disease, localisation of the tumour and the relatively high age of affected men, and leaves patients with a dismal prognosis. Given the palliative role of current treatments, attention has focused on the development of therapies targeted at non-androgenic mediators of prostate growth. Endothelin-1 (ET-1), a 21-amino-acid peptide produced by endothelial cells and prevalent in seminal fluid, has been identified as one such mediator. In addition to its potent mitogenic and vasoconstrictive properties, ET-1 has been shown to suppress apoptosis and induce angiogenesis. In HRPC cells, increased levels of ET-1 have been observed. ET-1 mediates its effects through two receptors, of which the endothelin-A (ET SUB A) receptor is most important in prostate cancer. An up-regulation of ET SUB A receptor levels and decreased expression of endothelin-B (ET SUB B) receptors is observed in HRPC cells. Taken together, these factors are thought to play a significant role in the progression of the disease. Research has, therefore, focused on development of ET-1 antagonists to disrupt the mitogenic and angiogenic effects of ET-1 and slow disease progression. As ET-1 is also an important factor in the development of new bone, ET-1 antagonists may potentially inhibit the development of skeletal metastases and associated pain, which characterise this disease. Atrasentan, a highly specific ET SUB A receptor antagonist, is currently in clinical development. Data are awaited from clinical trials to confirm the role of this agent in the treatment of HRPC.
