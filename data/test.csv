It is characterized by its propensity for bone metastases which occur in more than 80% of patients with advanced disease. Patients are at risk of complications including pain, hypercalcaemia, bone fracture and spinal cord compression. Hormonal treatment is the mainstay of treatment for these patients but most of them will then become hormone refractory. Bisphosphonates act by inhibiting osteoclast activities and are a potential therapeutic option for metastatic prostate cancer. In addition, they have been shown to reduce pain in patients with bone metastases as a consequence of multiple myeloma. Early uncontrolled studies of bisphosphonates in metastatic prostate cancer patients have shown encouraging results. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this review was to determine the effectiveness of bisphosphonates in relieving pain in patients with bone metastases from prostate cancer. SEARCH STRATEGY: Studies were identified by electronic search of bibliographic databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE, CancerLit and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register. Handsearching included Proceedings of American Society of Clinical Oncology and reference lists of all eligible trials identified. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled studies comparing the effectiveness of bisphosphonates with placebo or open control for pain relief in patients with bone metastases from prostate cancer. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data were extracted from eligible studies and included study design, participants, interventions and outcomes. Comparable data were pooled together for meta-analysis with intention-to-treat principle. Outcomes included pain response, analgesic consumption, skeletal events (including pathological fractures, spinal cord compression, bone radiotherapy, bone surgery), prostate cancer death, disease progression, radiological response, PSA response, adverse events, performance status, quality of life and comparisons between different routes, doses and types of bisphosphonates. MAIN RESULTS: One thousand nine hundred and fifty-five patients from ten studies were included in this review. The pain response rates were 27.9% and 21.1% for the treatment group and the control group, respectively, with an absolute risk difference of 6.8%. The OR for pain response was 1.54 (95% CI 0.97 to 2.44, P = 0.07), showing a trend of improved pain relief in the bisphosphonate group, although this was not statistically significant. The rates for skeletal events were 37.8% and 43.0% for the treatment group and the control group, respectively, with an absolute risk difference of 5.2%. The OR for skeletal events was 0.79 (95% CI 0.62 to 1.00, P = 0.05). A significant increase in nausea was observed in patients who received bisphosphonates compared to placebo. No increase in other adverse events was observed. There was no statistically significant difference between the bisphosphonate group and the control group in terms of prostate cancer death, disease progression, radiological response and PSA response. There are insufficient data to guide the choice of bisphosphonates or the dose and the route of administration . AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Bisphosphonates should be considered for patients with metastatic prostate cancer for the treatment of refractory bone pain and prevention of skeletal events. More research is needed to guide the choice of bisphosphonates, optimal treatment schedule as well as cost-benefit comparisons. Combining results from different studies is difficult because different tools were used to assess pain, and also, bisphosphonates vary considerably in potency. This review highlights the need for standardisation and co-ordination among researchers in cancer pain studies","","","","","","10.1002/14651858.CD006250 [doi]","University of Hong Kong, Centre of Infection, Hong Kong, China. kyyuen@hkucc.hku.hk","PM:17054286","","","",""

METHODS: Included in the study were 36 men with prostate cancer, suffering from painful osseous metastases and treated with (186)Re-HEDP. None had received any treatment that would have interfered with bone metabolism before (186)Re-HEDP treatment or throughout the follow-up period. For each patient, pretreatment and posttreatment serum levels of osteocalcin (OC), bone alkaline phosphatase (BALP), aminoterminal (PINP) and carboxyterminal (PICP) propeptides of type I collagen, amino-terminal (NTx) and carboxyterminal (CTx) telopeptides of type I collagen and their combinations were compared with the level and duration of pain response to radionuclide treatment. RESULTS: Pain response was correlated only with pretreatment NuTaux/PINP, PICP/PINP and NTx/CTx ratios and posttreatment decrease in baseline NTx and PICP values (p = 0.0025-0.035). According to multivariate and ROC analyses, the best marker-derived predictors of better and longer duration of response to (186)Re-HEDP treatment were a posttreatment decrease in NTx of > or = 20% (RR = 3.44, p = 0.0005) and a pretreatment NTx/PINP ratio of > or = 1.2 (RR = 3.04, p = 0.036) CONCLUSION: NTx, a potent collagenous marker of bone resorption, along with the novel NTx/PINP ratio provide useful cut-off values for identifying a group of patients suffering from painful osseous metastases from hormone-refractory prostatic carcinoma who do not respond to palliative treatment with (186)Re-HEDP. This information could help avoid an inefficient and expensive radionuclide treatment. Also, in the cohort of patients who will eventually undergo such treatment, the medium-term posttreatment changes in NTx offer valuable predictive information regarding long-term palliative response","","","","","","10.1007/s00259-009-1243-5 [doi]","Department of Nuclear Medicine, 401 Army Hospital of Athens, Mesogeion & Kanellopoulou 1, 11525, Athens, Greece, epiphany@in.gr","PM:19662405","","","",""

Signifcant alterations take place in the microenvironment of bone, which disturb the normal coupling that exists between bone resorption and bone formation. Consequently, a better understanding of the mechanisms that interact at the molecular level will defnitely result in more effective therapy for patients with this devastating complication of prostatic carcinoma. This review will discuss the diagnostic and predictive implications of various collagenous and non-collagenous bone markers, along with the novel markers of osteoclastogenesis and other matrix enzymes such as metalloproteinases and growth factors responsible for the complex biochemical mechanisms that upregulate bone resorption/formation during the development of metastasis. Further prospective studies are needed to determine whether any of these markers measured longitudinally in prostate cancer patients without bone scan evidence of skeletal disease will ultimately predict those patients who will develop bone metastases from their malignancy. Nonetheless, from the clinical point of view it is important to know that these novel mar kers carry the potential to provide meaningful information for daily practice by using upper normal reference values as cut-offs for identifying patients with an increased risk of developing progressive bone disease or skeletal related events","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of zoledronic acid on SREs in patients with bone metastases from bladder cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with bone metastases from bladder cancer who were receiving palliative radiotherapy were randomized to placebo or zoledronic acid (4 mg intravenous monthly) for 6 months. RESULTS: The patients (n = 40) were evenly distributed between the two treatment groups, and the baseline demographics of the two groups were similar. The follow-up varied from 8 to 65 weeks (median 24 weeks). Compared with patients receiving placebo, those receiving zoledronic acid had a lower mean incidence of SREs (2.05 +/- 1.0 vs. 0.95 +/- 0.9, respectively), and a larger proportion did not experience an on-study SRE (2 vs. 8 patients, respectively). Zoledronic acid also prolonged the median time to first SRE compared with the placebo (16 vs. 8 weeks, respectively). Multiple event analysis of SREs revealed that zoledronic acid decreased the risk of SRE development by 59% (hazard ratio 0.413). Zoledronic acid also increased the 1-year survival rate compared with placebo (36.3 +/- 11.2 vs. 0%, respectively). Zoledronic acid was generally well tolerated in our patient population. CONCLUSIONS: Zoledronic acid therapy decreased the incidence of SREs and improved the 1-year survival rate of patients with bone metastases from bladder cancer, potentially through its anticancer activity","","","","","","10.1007/s10147-010-0074-5 [doi]","Radiation Oncology Department, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt. mszagh@yahoo.com","PM:20354750","","","",""

The purpose of this article was to evaluate the pharmacoeconomics of available treatments for metastatic prostate cancer, including hormone-sensitive disease, androgen-independent prostate cancer and locally advanced/progressive disease. We identified 58 articles addressing economic issues related to metastatic prostate cancer. Treatment alternatives with considerably different costs are available in many areas of disease management, most notably, medical androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) versus surgical castration; combined androgen blockage (CAB) versus monotherapy for initial treatment of hormone-sensitive disease; as well as bisphosphonates and bone-targeted radioisotopes for palliation. The few available pharmacoeconomic studies indicate that the additional costs are not supported by clear and compelling evidence of differences in survival or quality-of-life (QOL) outcomes. Our review revealed that authors often use considerably different assumptions about efficacy and survival outcomes in their analyses, which may be due to the inconsistency of available clinical evidence. Although there have been many clinical trials comparing various therapies, we identified only three trials that included economic assessments. Thus, few sources of economic data are available and most pharmacoeconomic studies rely on information mined from indirect sources. We note that, while there has been considerable enthusiasm about the role of docetaxel regimens in the past 2 years, no study has yet examined the costs of these therapies. Survival remains poor for metastatic disease, thus QOL is the primary consideration for many therapies. However, QOL for treatment of metastatic disease is poorly measured and, in most analyses, the impact of therapy on QOL was inferred based on speculation by the authors. Given the large cost burdens of these treatments, it is essential that we more fully understand the true QOL gains potentially offered by more expensive therapies. The economic studies of advanced prostate cancer highlight several aspects of clinical care that are filled with considerable uncertainty and remain guided by forces other than optimal resource allocation. It is essential that we address the weaknesses in our understanding of the economic consequences of therapies for prostate cancer, and find ways to include economic information into the process of determining optimal therapy","","","","","","2544 [pii]","Division of Public Health Sciences, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington, USA","PM:17402804","","","",""

METHODS: We isolated cells from surgical resections of 21 prostate tumors and measured apoptosis and viability in these primary cells and 17 established cell lines from human prostate, bladder, renal cell and testicular carcinomas. RESULTS: We found that dexamethasone induces resistance regarding exposure to several cytotoxic agents such as taxol, gemcitabine, cisplatin, 5-FU and gamma-irradiation in 86% of the freshly isolated prostate tumors and in 100% of the established urological cell lines. No difference in dexamethasone-mediated protection was found in normal, benign and malignant prostate tumors. CONCLUSIONS: These data show for the first time that dexamethasone induced therapy resistance in urological carcinomas is not the exception but a more common phenomenon and implicate that glucocorticoids may have two faces in cancer therapy, a beneficial and a dangerous one","","","","","","2272 [pii]","Molecular Urooncology, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany","PM:16294015","","","",""

MATERIALS AND METHODS: 83 patients with metastatic hormone-refractory prostate cancer were enrolled in the trial and given a combination of docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) intravenously on day 2 or mitoxantrone 12 mg/m(2) on day 1 plus prednisone 5 mg twice daily on days 1-21, 21 days a cycle. Serum PSA level, relief of bone pain, myelosuppression, and vomiting were recorded and calculated. RESULTS: Docetaxel plus prednisone was administered to 44 patients: 13.6% (6/44) of them achieved complete response, 29.5% (13/44) partial response, 29.5% (13/44) had stable disease, and 27.3% (12/44) had disease progression. The average time to PSA progression was 37.8 weeks (12-101 weeks) in the response and stable disease patients. The 12 patients with disease progression were given MP as salvage therapy, and 16.7% (2/12) achieved a partial response, 25.0% (3/12) had stable disease and formed the new baseline. Only 2 patients died of disease aggravation. Mitoxantrone plus prednisone were given to 39 patients, and 7.7% (3/39) of them achieved complete response, 25.6% (10/39) partial response, 25.6% (10/39) had a stable disease, and 41.0% (16/39) of patients had disease progression. The mean time to PSA progression was 25.3 weeks (8-61 weeks) in the response and stable disease patients. The 14 patients with disease progression were administered DP as a salvage therapy and 7.1% (1/14) achieved complete response, 35.7% (5/14) partial response, and 21.4% (3/14) had stable disease and formed the new baseline. Four patients had died at the last follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: In Chinese patients, docetaxel plus prednisone is better than mitoxantrone plus prednisone in PSA response rate and PSA control, but has a bit more toxicity. When the tumor is resistant to one regimen, the other might still be effective in controlling disease progression","","","","","","000109714 [pii];10.1159/000109714 [doi]","Department of Urology, Cancer Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, PR China","PM:18025847","","","",""

Such poor progress results from the biological basis of the disease, localisation of the tumour and the relatively high age of affected men, and leaves patients with a dismal prognosis. Given the palliative role of current treatments, attention has focused on the development of therapies targeted at non-androgenic mediators of prostate growth. Endothelin-1 (ET-1), a 21-amino-acid peptide produced by endothelial cells and prevalent in seminal fluid, has been identified as one such mediator. In addition to its potent mitogenic and vasoconstrictive properties, ET-1 has been shown to suppress apoptosis and induce angiogenesis. In HRPC cells, increased levels of ET-1 have been observed. ET-1 mediates its effects through two receptors, of which the endothelin-A (ET SUB A) receptor is most important in prostate cancer. An up-regulation of ET SUB A receptor levels and decreased expression of endothelin-B (ET SUB B) receptors is observed in HRPC cells. Taken together, these factors are thought to play a significant role in the progression of the disease. Research has, therefore, focused on development of ET-1 antagonists to disrupt the mitogenic and angiogenic effects of ET-1 and slow disease progression. As ET-1 is also an important factor in the development of new bone, ET-1 antagonists may potentially inhibit the development of skeletal metastases and associated pain, which characterise this disease. Atrasentan, a highly specific ET SUB A receptor antagonist, is currently in clinical development. Data are awaited from clinical trials to confirm the role of this agent in the treatment of HRPC.
